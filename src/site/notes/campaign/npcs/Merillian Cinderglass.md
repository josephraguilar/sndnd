## Notes
from 

king and queen have sent him here to persuade the chieftain
 [[campaign/npcs/Ugmarn One Tusk\|Ugmarn One Tusk]] to begin trade with them, they need raw materials from [[campaign/locations/Velen\|Velen]] and have stuff to trade back
when he was speaking with [[campaign/npcs/Ugmarn One Tusk\|Ugmarn One Tusk]] one of the etiquette was to drink wine with scorpion poison

he didnt drink it, then [[campaign/npcs/Ugmarn One Tusk\|Ugmarn One Tusk]] imprisoned him for it. He asked the party to get back into his good graces, which we did.
