## Notes
we traded her the [[campaign/items/Galdrabrock\|Galdrabrock]] for information on tainted blood and how to open the cursed collars. 

We agreed to exchange the [[campaign/items/Book of Necromancy\|Book of Necromancy]] and and the [[campaign/items/Book on 8th Level of Hell\|Book on 8th Level of Hell]] in exchange for information on how to enter the [[campaign/locations/Temple of the high Cleric\|Temple of the high Cleric]]. We considered betraying her, but were met with too strong a force to do so.
