# [[campaign/items/Embris's Letter\|Embris's Letter]]
 To My Stalwart Kin of Stone and Soil, 

The embers whisper of change, and the winds carry the scent of destiny. It has been too Long since we four have stood together, bound by our sacred charge. But the time for solitude is over. The path to the Promised Land still eludes us, and I believe the final piece of the map is within reach —if we unite once more.

I have seen visions in the fire, glimpses of an ancient text buried beneath roots older than time itself. If my suspicions are correct, it is hidden where earth and water meet—a place known only to you or our kin of the tides. We can no longer afford to seek it alone. The balance of the elements depends on what we uncover.

[[campaign/npcs/Sylphine, the Whispering Gale\|Sylphine, the Whispering Gale]], and [[campaign/npcs/Torrain, the Tideborn Sage\|Torrain, the Tideborn Sage]], have also been summoned. We must meet at the Crossroads of the Four Pillars when the next moon is full. Bring what knowledge you have, for the flames grow restless, and time is no longer our ally. The fire calls, and I will answer. Will you?



May the mountains stand firm beneath your feet,
