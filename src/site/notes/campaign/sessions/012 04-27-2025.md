> The party was ambushed by the **Black Maw Tribe**, then drawn through portals into the fey realm of **Lady Thistledawn**, where they stood trial for **Gunther’s past crimes**. Stripped of their names, they journeyed to the **Echo Tree** to reclaim them and found another fragment of the **map to the Promised Land** hidden within a magical locket. Having regained their identities, they returned to the **Ogre Wastelands**, their destiny further entwined with fey magic and prophecy.

## AI Summary
While traveling through the wilds, the party spotted two columns of smoke in the distance. **SB** was sent ahead to scout, and through his eyes, **Kormak** saw a shrine devoted to **Gruumsh**, surrounded by an orc encampment. The group confronted the orc zealots in battle and triumphed, though their enemy **Garkul** was nowhere to be found.

As they investigated the area, they discovered that the camp was built around an **ancient dwarven mining complex** known as **Kund Vethrak — the Eye of Gruumsh**. Once a proud dwarven stronghold, the site had been desecrated and repurposed by orcs into a place of dark worship. Upon exploring deeper, the party found a **hidden entrance** leading **30–40 feet** underground, followed by a steep descent of nearly **100 feet** into a **vast dwarven great hall**, its stonework still magnificent but now scarred by corruption and shadowed by the presence of Gruumsh’s faithful.

## Log
While traveling, we spot two columns of smoke in the distance. **SB** is sent out to scout, and through him, **Kormak** sees a shrine dedicated to **Gruumsh**. It appears to be within an orc encampment.

We approach and engage the orcs — zealots devoted to [[campaign/npcs/Gruumsh\|Gruumsh]]. The party defeats them but [[campaign/npcs/Garkul\|Garkul]] is not there.  After defeating them, we take the night to rest outside what we soon learn is an **old dwarven mining site**, now overtaken by the orcs.

The structure is called **[[campaign/locations/6_sites/Kund Vethrak\|Kund Vethrak]]**, known as _the Eye of Gruumsh_. The central section appears to have been modified by the orcs, but much of the surrounding structure still bears the craftsmanship of dwarves.

Upon investigation, we discover a concealed entrance with a ladder descending roughly **30 to 40 feet** into a vast, sloped chamber. Continuing downward, we descend another **100 feet** into a massive great hall carved deep within the stone — a grand dwarven hall now shadowed by the corruption of Gruumsh’s followers.
