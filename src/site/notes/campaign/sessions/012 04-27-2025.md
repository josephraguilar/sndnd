## Log
While traveling, we spot two columns of smoke in the distance. **SB** is sent out to scout, and through him, **Kormak** sees a shrine dedicated to **Gruumsh**. It appears to be within an orc encampment.

We approach and engage the orcs — zealots devoted to [[campaign/npcs/Gruumsh\|Gruumsh]]. The party defeats them but [[campaign/npcs/Garkul\|Garkul]] is not there.  After defeating them, we take the night to rest outside what we soon learn is an **old dwarven mining site**, now overtaken by the orcs.

The structure is called **[[campaign/locations/6_sites/Kund Vethrak\|Kund Vethrak]]**, known as _the Eye of Gruumsh_. The central section appears to have been modified by the orcs, but much of the surrounding structure still bears the craftsmanship of dwarves.

Upon investigation, we discover a concealed entrance with a ladder descending roughly **30 to 40 feet** into a vast, sloped chamber. Continuing downward, we descend another **100 feet** into a massive great hall carved deep within the stone — a grand dwarven hall now shadowed by the corruption of Gruumsh’s followers.
