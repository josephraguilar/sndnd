## Session Summary
> [!tldr] [[campaign/sessions/026 11-09-2025\|026 11-09-2025]]
> After days of sailing through storms, ghostly fog, and strange sea creatures, the crew reaches Baldur’s Gate. They deliver a cursed relic — the Whispering Reliquary — to Knifebloom of the Dark Daggers in a secret chamber beneath a bathhouse. The relic contains the tongue of an orcish seer tied to a dark prophecy of Gruumsh’s rise. The party leaves the city richer in gold and knowledge, though uneasy about the power they helped deliver.

## AI Summary
Over several days at sea, the crew sails through shifting weather and encounters strange omens. On the 10th day, they pass through a dense, cold fog before emerging into clear skies. Later, Kormak spots distant ship lights that pass harmlessly. The following night, the ship is struck by something massive — revealed to be a colossal sea turtle scratching its neck on the hull. Ophie communicates with it, helping soothe the creature before it departs peacefully.

On the 12th day, they encounter a Baldur’s Gate ship and exchange friendly signals. The next day, they pass a vessel bearing a gold cross on a royal blue flag, identified later as a ship from Neverwinter. That night, the party hears eerie muffled moans from the haunted box aboard.

By the 14th day, Baldur’s Gate comes into view. Obold inquires about the Knives Eye and learns it’s tied to the Dark Daggers. The party visits the Velvet Veil to meet Valana and is guided by Corvin, a pirate-like member of the guild. They’re introduced to Knifebloom, a scarred half-elf woman who leads them to a secret chamber beneath the Silk Steam Bathhouse. There, the group meets the Dark Daggers’ inner circle, uncovers that their mysterious crate contains the _Whispering Reliquary_ — the severed, sentient tongue of an orcish seer once devoted to Gruumsh — and learns of its dark promises. Knifebloom warns them not to meddle with it, revealing it to be a relic of prophecy tied to orcish domination of Faerûn.

Afterward, Corvin explains the guild’s tattoo-based hierarchy before escorting them to the Guilded Token, where they shop for potions and magical rings. With their errand complete, the crew celebrates their safe return to Baldur’s Gate.

## Log
Midday on the 10th day, we see a giant gray sky ahead of us. We then see a giant fog bank headed towards us. as we start to go through we feel cold wetness of the fog, almost like its weighing down. we slow down, as the wind of the fog is moving against us.,  As we we pull through, we see blue skies ahead of us. 

late into the evening of the 10th day, Kormak is on watch and sees what looks like lights on another ship. We can see that they're in the same shipping lane as the other ships that passed us. it passes us with no event. 

on the 11th day, nighttime, Lois  feels a thud on the right front side of the ship. Gamora tells Lois to go look, and as she does she sees a green round thing with two feet splashing in the wave. It is LARGE. She then feels it hit the other side of the ship. Obold is investigating the hull as others are checking the topside of the ship. Thorin, Gunther, and Kormak see a shell swimming around and hitting the ship. We find no damage to the hull under the ship. Ophie sees that it is a giant turtle. Ophie tells it to leave us alone. It says , "Im just trying to scratch an itch on his neck" Ophie then helps scratch his neck.  and then he leaves us alone. 

on day 12 on the early morning light we see another ship. as it gets closer, we see it has a Baldurs gate flag, same as we do. Alias waves at it and they wave back.  and pass

13th day, Ophie sees another ship in the lane. it is waving a flag we are unfamiliar with. it looks like a gold equal sided cross on a royal blue background. 

![neverwinterflag.png](/img/user/data/images/neverwinterflag.png)

Alias messages mags, she tells us it is the flag of Neverwinter and that she saild south of velen

evening of the 13th Thorin sees another set of ship lanterns. it passes without issue.

That night, Ophie and and alias hear the haunted box moaning like it is muffled or someone is holding its mouth closed.

day 14 the party sees port city of Baldurs gate in the distance. We make it to the bay, it seems very busy. we find a spot to land the ship. 

Obold asks about the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Knives Eye\|Knives Eye]] and the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Knives Eye\|Knives Eye]], the dockmaster says that is involving the dark daggers. Thorin and Obold stay on the boat with the haunted chest. 

the party goes to the velvet veil and speaks with someone explaining we want to talk to Valan. a man walks out shortly after, dressed very pirate-like. he is human and looks familiar. we saw him last time we were in the velvet veil. 

He escorts the party back to speak with [[campaign/npcs/Valan\|Valan]].  turns out [[campaign/npcs/Knifebloom\|Knifebloom]] is a person at the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Knives Eye\|Knives Eye]]. The swashbuckler males' name is [[campaign/npcs/Corvin\|Corvin]]

Corvin comes back with a silver white haired half elf female with one eye scarred from an old dagger wound. she is wearing a really nice long velvet dress, similar to a robe. she looks to be about 30

Valan explains to Knifebloom that we have a package for her. Knifebloom instructs us to deliver it to the knives eye. Corvin goes with us to get a cart and comes with us to ensure we get the package delivered to the knives eye. Corvin explains to us that the knives eye is just another clandestine meeting location for the dark daggers. 

Alias befriends Corvin on the way back to the boat and Corvin explains that every [[campaign/factions/Dark Daggers\|Dark Daggers]] who joins must first pass initiation. once they pass they get their first tattoo, considered "the point". one tattoo - being in the point. More than one tattoo, you are a part of "the edge" third level or third tattoo = the fang. the more tattoos the higher level you are in the guild. explains they don't even know where Scalius is all the time. only people who have been "responsible" for the guild have had 7 daggers. 

we eventually make it to the knives eye. Corvin explains they don't take a lot of people here. He says its in the back of the building, we have to go through the front which is a room called the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Silk Steam Bathhouse\|Silk Steam Bathhouse]]. 

Led by Corvin, we are walked to the back of the bathhouse. AN attendant pushes a button on the wall, a secret door opens leading to a narrow staircase. Corvin walks us down the staircase. as we go down we smell iron and floral scents. at the bottom of the staircase is a large circular room with a  large round polished blackwood table. On it there is 9 wine goblets and two bottles of dark looking wine. next to one of the bottles is a large ritual cutting knife. there are multiple alcoves with people standing in the alcoves. 

Knifebloom walks out of the shadows, she looks at us and says, we carry the debt of [[campaign/npcs/Scalius\|Scalius]], please. sit. we all cheers and drink to Scalius. she asks why we were in debt to Scalius. we explain we are loyal to Scalius for helping us, and her eyes darted to Corvin for a second. 

They have a servant open the box. he pulls out a small black polished ebony treasure chest. hinges and latch are silver, chased with the image of twin serpents devouring each other. he says its cold to the touch.  she puts her hand on the sides of it. she open the smaller chest, and a small velvet blanket is wrapped around an obsidian urn. with red crystal veins that are pulsing. there are eyes and mouths all over etched in. we hear from the urn the same whispers we heard from before. saying, "let me out, i will fulfill your every fantasy". 

knifebloom drinks more wine and says its [[campaign/items/Whispering Reliquary\|Whispering Reliquary]]. the severed tongue of an ancient orcish seer is in there. She was a seer who spoke prophecies for the god [[campaign/npcs/Gruumsh\|Gruumsh]]. she said we probably shouldn't mess with it. we asked about the prophecy, she said the orcs have a prophecy that they will one day rule all of Faerun. 

Obold asks if Knifebloom knows about releasing souls from halberds, she says no but we could go to the [[campaign/locations/1_continents/Underdark\|Underdark]] to ask [[campaign/npcs/Lolth\|Lolth]] ourself. 

Kormak asks what store we should go to. Corvin says we should go to [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Gilded Token\|Gilded Token]] and speak with [[campaign/npcs/Edris Three Fingers Malorn\|Edris Three Fingers Malorn]]. 

Kaneko goes to the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Dockside Bear\|Dockside Bear]] for information

the gilded token is a nice place and is full of all kinds of things. its a general store. we buy some potions, obold gets a ring of featherfall and ring of water breathing. 

the party celebrates and leaves Baldurs gate.
