> The party parlayed with a Gwynneth ship and learned the true history of King Ardyn, the so-called Betrayer King, as well as the locations of the Galdur Towers. Arriving at Llorgh, they searched for information about Obold’s past and learned of growing tensions, fewer Veruz Rexna arrivals, and increased Uganathi activity. While traveling toward the goliath encampment, they were ambushed by raptors and defeated them, executing their dire scale brute leader. The group continued toward the volcano’s forest to rest.

## AI Summary
Before setting out, Obold makes the party promise that if the choice is ever forced upon them, they must save his mother, Kaela—even if it costs him his life. With that heavy vow hanging in the air, the group departs, Louis riding alongside Obold as they travel.

Not long into the journey, the smell of smoke reaches them. Obold recognizes it as a campfire—deliberate and contained, not the scent of a burning structure. As they draw closer, Louis begins to hear guttural voices echoing through the trees. Kaneko and Alias move ahead to scout: Alias crawls low along the forest floor while Kaneko climbs a tree for a better vantage point. From above, Kaneko witnesses a grim scene—half-goliaths celebrating over the slain bodies of lizardfolk, while full goliaths stomp out lizardfolk eggs scattered across the ground.

During the approach, Alias receives a casual message on his whisper quill from Magnolia Duvall asking what he’s doing. His reply is blunt and ill-timed: “About to fuck up some goliaths, hbu?” Moments later, as Kaneko descends from the tree, a goliath notices movement and growls a warning. The goliaths begin moving toward Kaneko’s position. Kaneko and Alias retreat quickly and alert the party that the enemy force is advancing. The group hastily prepares an ambush.

Obold steps forward, feigning injury and posing as a wounded goliath to lure them in. When the enemies close the distance, Kaneko unleashes a sudden barrage of arrows, springing the trap and catching the goliaths off guard. They quickly surround Obold as Louis readies a fireball, waiting for Obold to disengage. Ophie summons bears into the fray and transforms into one herself, tearing into goliaths and half-goliaths alike. Alias darts in, strikes a goliath, and slips back out of reach.

Obold engages the largest goliath landing a devastating critical blow before misty stepping away. With Obold clear, Ophie releases her fireball, incinerating two half-goliaths in a blast of flame. The battle drags on, brutal and exhausting, as the party struggles against the natural resilience of barbarian goliaths. At last, the enemies fall.

Irgrak shows up and Obold engages him. Obold begins taunting him and referring to him as "The Weakest" of his brothers. In the aftermath, Obold grapples Irgrak and demands answers about Kaela. Irgrak claims that the last time he saw her—about five weeks ago—she was still alive. Obold takes Irgrak’s skull as a grim trophy, discarding the lizardfolk head without ceremony. The party withdraws to rest, then presses onward toward a farming village Obold remembers as the source of food for the goliath warriors.

Approaching from the forest’s edge, they see wide fields of cultivated farmland. Owls sent to scout reveal women, children, and other goliaths and half-goliaths living and working the land. What had once been a simple plan—to burn the fields and starve the warriors—now becomes a moral dilemma. Faced with a peaceful village rather than a military target, the party pauses, torn over what course of action to take next.

During downtime, the party pieces together what they’ve learned:  
Irgrak served as the hunter.  
Thavrak was responsible for farming and sustaining the group.  
Lazrack trained the half-goliath warriors.  
Grudrack, Obold’s father, remains in the main lair—hidden within caverns beneath the volcano.

## Log
Obold instructs the party to save his mother Kaela and not him if the decision ever comes to it. 

The party heads off, Louis is riding with Obold

The party smells smoke, and obold can tell it smells like a campfire but it could be something other than a campfire. It does not smell structural. As we approach Louis hears gutteral noises from some type of creatures. Kaneko and alias sneak up to get a view. Alias crawls in the ground, while kaneko climbs int a tree. from the tree, kaneko sees a group of half-goliaths who have killed some lizard folk, and are celebrating killing the lizards. There are some full goliaths with them, and are stomping out eggs from the lizards. 

While sneaking, Alias' gets a message on his whisper quill from [[campaign/npcs/Magnolia Duvall\|Magnolia Duvall]] asking what he's doing. Alias says "about to fuck up some goliath's, hbu?"

As kaneko is sliding down the tree, one of the Goliaths turns towards his direction and recognizes something and utters something towards the other goliaths and they look towards kaneko's directions. The Goliaths start heading towards Kaneko, him and alias head back to the party and inform them that the group of goliaths and half goliaths are on their way. The party concots a plan to ambush them as they approach.

Obold pretends to be an injured goliath and baits them into the parties trap, once near, Kaneko lets off a flury of arrows, starting combat and catching the goliaths by surprise. They quickly surround obold. Thinking tactically, lois prepares a fireball for once obold gets out of the way. Ophie summons some bears and transforms into a bear herself and begin mauling the goliaths and half goliaths. Alias runs in, stabs a goliath and leaves the area. Obold attacks the large goliath, hitting it critically, then misty steps away, letting Ophie lets loose her fireball, incenarting two of the half goliaths. The ensuing battle was long and hard, with each of us struggling to deal damage due to the resistances of barbarians and goliaths. Eventually we defeat the enemies, with Obold grappling Irgrak and demanding to know where his mother Kaela is. Irgrak says that last he saw, Kaela was alive, about 5 weeks ago. Obold takes the skull of irgrak disacarding the lizardfolk head. . The party then leaves and takes a long rest, headed towards the farming village where the food for the goliath gang gets their food, going off obolds memory. We arrive at the town, skirting the forest. We see fields of farmland. We sent owls out to scout the farmland  and see irgrak observing the fields, lots of women, children, and other goliaths and half goliaths. The party puased the session plotting what to do. The original plan was to raze the farmland to cutoff food supply to the warrriors, but now the party is faced with a peaceful village with woman and children and are morally torn about how to handle this. 



In the downtime the part learns the following.

irgrak was the hunter 
thavrak was the farmer, making sure they 
Lazrack, the trainer of all the half-goliath trainees

Grudrack will be in the main lair, in caverns underneath the Volcano
