## AI Summary
After cleaning up the aftermath and befriending [[campaign/npcs/Yorga\|Yorga]], [[campaign/npcs/Pip\|Pip]], and [[campaign/npcs/Bo Duvall\|Bo Duvall]], the party returned to their ship. The next morning, eight eerie, child-sized figures in black cloaks arrived, delivering a scroll and a sealed crate from [[campaign/npcs/Scalius\|Scalius]] of the [[campaign/factions/Dark Daggers\|Dark Daggers]], bound for [[campaign/locations/Knifebloom\|Knifebloom]] at the [[campaign/locations/Knives Eye\|Knives Eye]] in [[campaign/locations/Baldur's Gate\|Baldur's Gate]]. The crate radiated powerful undead energy and whispered to [[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] in a female orcish voice, promising favors for the crew. The party secured it and set sail.

Over the ten-day voyage, they encountered multiple dangers: a playful young black dragon, a pursuing ship destroyed by **Thorin’s** control water, a deadly storm where Alias guided us safely, and an undead pirate vessel whose captain was annihilated by [[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] divine strike. Later, they aided a Waterdeep ship under attack by the **Shag Dominica**, with **Obold** converting six foes in a dramatic display. The session ended as another encounter approached.

## Log
The party cleaned up the bodies and made friends with [[campaign/npcs/Yorga\|Yorga]], [[campaign/npcs/Pip\|Pip]], and [[campaign/npcs/Bo Duvall\|Bo Duvall]]. They took a short rest and headed for their ship. 

The crew arrived at their ship with no issues. Early the following morning a greenish glow occurs along the shore. As [[campaign/players/Louis\|Louis]]and [[campaign/players/Alias\|Alias]] are keeping watch a skiff appears with 8 small figures approaching. Each child sized with black cloaks too big for them. each one has a red cloth mask that shimmers with sea oil. using unnatural unison. 

one stood up and waved back at [[campaign/players/Louis\|Louis]] . [[campaign/players/Alias\|Alias]] went to rouse everyone from sleep. the white hand turned out to be a white glove and not a skeleton hand

they dock next to our ship and begin to climb the ship.  [[campaign/players/Louis\|Louis]] helps one board, and it hands us a scroll from the dark daggers with a large S on it. 

[[campaign/players/Louis\|Louis]] opens the scroll , it is form Scalius and it says to "deliver the chest to [[campaign/locations/Knifebloom\|Knifebloom]] at the [[campaign/locations/Knives Eye\|Knives Eye]] in [[campaign/locations/Baldur's Gate\|Baldur's Gate]], do not open it, do not listen to it."

They help us load a large crate onto the ship. there a strange runes on the chest. with a wax seal across the opening, with velum that has the stamp of the dark daggers and [[campaign/npcs/Scalius\|Scalius]] writing saying "deliver". 


[[campaign/players/Gunther\|Gunther]] shakes it and perceives that something is shifting in the box, but its been packaged well. Doesn't seem like liquid or anything alive is in the box. There are no holes in the box. 

The little people seem to have humanoid eyes. Their elven, or half elven, or human. 

[[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] detects very evil undead from the box

The team decides to keep the box, chain it further

as [[campaign/players/Gunther\|Gunther]] is carrying the box to the hull, he hears a whispering voice call his name in orcish. He dropped the box but nothing super bad happened. 

as we all talk about the box, the box asks [[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] to open it, and says it can do things for [[campaign/players/Kormak\|Kormak]] and [[campaign/players/Louis\|Louis]] 

[[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] recognizes it to be a female orcish voice. he asks her name, and the box says, "I have no name. None worth discussing."

The gang started traveling to [[campaign/locations/Baldur's Gate\|Baldur's Gate]].

on the morning of the second day. 

we passed two boats, one from [[campaign/locations/Baldur's Gate\|Baldur's Gate]], another from [[campaign/locations/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]]. we went straight passed

on the third day we saw a large bird approaching us./ after closer inspection we realized its a black dragon. it appears to be a "large" dragon, or young adult. 

it says to us in common "hahaha LOVE IT" and spits acid into the water.  then flies away, it seems he was testing his new Fearing abilities on us. 

on the 6th day towards the end of the day. we hear a large rhythmic beating, kind of the cadence of rowing. The evil box we got from [[campaign/npcs/Scalius\|Scalius]] whispers to us all in orcish "you're in trouble... better speed up"

Rain starts pouring down.  We see a boat appear behind us and approaching. we hear more drums coming from the ship as it gains on us. It's not flying any flag. 

[[campaign/players/Thorin\|Thorin]] cast control water and created a trench infront of the boat, causing it to launch half the crew into the water and continued to control the water, thrashing and completely annihilating the crew of the other ship. 

on day 7, a large storm started to approach the boat. Alias began trying to maneuver the boat LIKE THE CAPTAIN HE IS. The crew got thrashed around and multiple members went into the water. Thanks to [[campaign/players/Thorin\|Thorin]]'s water walk, most of us were fine, but one crewmember almost drowned. [[campaign/players/Ophie\|Ophie]] wild shaped into a shark and pulled him out of the water. [[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] successfully laid his hands over his solar plexus and resuscitated. 

on day 8,  we see a large ship approaching us in our path. its larger than our ship, and we saw a lot of people on the deck. It looked like a larger galley, not a war ship. [[campaign/players/Kormak\|Kormak]] sent the owl to investigate. There were quite a few mercenaries, and its not flying a flag or appear to be affiliated.  it passed us with no event. 

on day 9 we se a ship approach form the side (not down the shipping lane), and behind it was a very large black cloud. it appeared to be trying to intercept us. [[campaign/players/Thorin\|Thorin]] used redirect flow to try and redirect the water and push the ship away. The Flag seems to be a skull and crossbones flag. 

as it approached, we realized it was undead, and despite [[campaign/players/Thorin\|Thorin]]'s water control, the ship still rammed us. Gunther and a crewmate got posesses in the fight, but [[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] attacked the captain in a valiant strike that critically truck the ghost captain in a  a red flash. as the ghost captain was obliterated, the ship left away and sunk into the water as [[campaign/players/Gunther\|Gunther]] flew back ([[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] just thinks he can fly now)

on the 10th day, a ship approached us. it looked similar to the [[campaign/locations/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]] ship we saw previously. Behind the ship, there are sea creatures following it. The [[campaign/locations/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]] ship was firing arrows at them, and once close we realized they were the [[campaign/factions/Shag Dominica\|Shag Dominica]] riding sharks. The gang quickly took out many of them quickly. [[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] was able to convert 6 of the crew with a heroic superman pose when he misty stepped up to the crows nest and broke it, collecting 6 copper pieces in his new alms box. 

Just as we were ending the session another encounter was struck the misfortunate crew.
