> The party learned from Fiyel Lok about the Three Hags and attended the Parade of Slaves, where Corin Mag displayed his power and Cilia’s dance entranced the crowd. They later deciphered infernal commands from the Galdrabrock and followed Kira through a secret passage beneath the Temple of the High Cleric in search of the Dancer. Inside, they fought followers of Iuz and discovered the books they sought were missing. Exploring deeper, they looted treasure rooms and became trapped in a strange chamber where the door vanished after taking gemstones.

## AI Summary
The party escaped the sealed chamber thanks to Gunther’s brute strength and found themselves in a prison area filled with cells. Inside, they freed several captives — three halflings, a human named Thwayne, a dwarven woman named Holda, and a powerful tiefling named Salyx, who turned out to be Thexus’s brother and easily overpowered both Obold and Gunther. After some playful banter between Alias and Salyx, the group continued deeper into the temple in search of the missing books. They eventually encountered two of the Three hags along with members of the Shag Dominica, leading to a fierce battle in which the party emerged victorious, killing the cultists and one of the sea hags and finding the two books they were in search of.

## Log
The party escaped the trapped room through the brute force of [[campaign/players/Gunther\|Gunther]]. 
Trying to escape the party made it to a room with lots of cells. We unlocked one and found 3 slave halflings and one tiefling named [[campaign/npcs/Salyx\|Salyx]] who was able to wrestle both [[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] andGunther. Salyx is [[campaign/npcs/Thexus\|Thexus]]'s brother. Amongst the other slaves we found was a human named [[campaign/npcs/Thwayne\|Thwayne]] and a dwarven woman named [[campaign/npcs/Holda\|Holda]]. 

[[campaign/players/Alias\|Alias]] playfully argued with Salyx for a bit before the group left to find the books. Eventually the party entered a room with two of [[campaign/factions/The Three\|The Three]] hags and some members of the [[campaign/factions/Shag Dominica\|Shag Dominica]]. 

A fight breaks out in which the party defeats the members of the Shag Dominica as well as one of the sea hags.
