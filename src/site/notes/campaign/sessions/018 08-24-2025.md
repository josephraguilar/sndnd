#### **Ideas & Objectives**

- **Ledger Gamble:**  
    Forge slave transfer papers to gain access to restricted zones.
    
- **Festival of Chains:**  
    Holiday celebrated by orcs.
    
    - Possible opportunity to create a diversion or explosion to aid infiltration.
        
- **Inside Job:**  
    Dark Dagger operative (possible mole) within the slave networks.
    
- **Viola:**  
    Revealed to be **Thorin’s daughter**.
    
- We encountered **Artenia**, who is working with **Scallius** to ensure the slaver group doesn’t suspect her of betrayal.

#### **Key Locations in Gorvakutha**

- **Grudyards:** Where slaves are kept.
    
- **Mound of Black Breath:** Entrance to the mines.
    
- **Scorched Quarters:** Orc barracks.
    
- **Hellborn Bazaar:** Market district.
    
- **Chainspire Tower:**
    
    - **Ruzu’s lair**, containing manifest plans and “special slaves.”
        
    - **Ruzu and Zaryrok** are located at the top of the tower.

#### **More Ideas**
