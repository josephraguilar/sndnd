> The party defeated orcs of the **Bloodfang Tribe**, confronting Grolgrath’s haunted past and uncovering a dark **Baphomet-linked amulet** used to control a creature. On their path to **Gorvakutha**, they allied with **Bol**, leader of a lycanthropic pack, promising to recover a lost talisman in exchange for a future favor. Disguised as slavers and slaves, they entered the grim, prison-like city and met **Scallius** of the **Dark Daggers**, their long-awaited contact.

## AI Summary
While the dwarves and narrator remained behind with the wagon, the rest of the party scouted **Gorvakutha**, an oppressive industrial city ruled by orcs and slavers, and began devising a plan to infiltrate its inner sectors. Their objectives centered around freeing slaves and discovering the fate of **Thorin’s daughter, Viola**, who was confirmed to be among the captives. Working alongside **Scallius** and **Artenia**, a covert ally embedded in the slaver network, they identified key opportunities for infiltration — most notably the upcoming **Festival of Chains**, a brutal orcish celebration that could serve as cover for a coordinated rebellion known as the **Song of Freedom**.

The team brainstormed several strategic angles: forging **slave transfer papers** to access restricted areas, staging an **explosive diversion** during the festival, and leveraging an **inside contact** among the slave handlers. Key locations in Gorvakutha were mapped — the **Grudyards** (slave pens), **Mound of Black Breath** (mine entrance), **Scorched Quarters** (orc barracks), **Hellborn Bazaar** (trade hub), and the **Chainspire Tower**, the heart of the slaver operation where **Ruzu** and **Zaryrok** commanded operations from its summit. The party’s end goal was clear: ignite an uprising during the festival, free the slaves, and secure an escape route through the mines before the city descended into chaos.
