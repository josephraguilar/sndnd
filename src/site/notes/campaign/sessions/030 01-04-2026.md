> The party ambushed a goliath-held farming settlement using summoned wolves to scatter defenders and protect civilians, before launching a brutal, chaotic assault. Amid freed livestock, raging warriors, and devastating magic, Obold discovered one of the goliaths was his uncle, Thavrak. Through clever magic and relentless pressure, the party isolated and killed him after learning Kaela still lived. The session ended with the townsfolk evacuated and the symbols of Iuz burned to ash.

## AI Summary
The party attempts to take a short rest. During this time, **Obold gifts Gunther Thavrack his glaive**. Near the end of the rest, the party is interrupted by a sudden **snake attack**.

During the fight, the party receives aid from an **unknown ranger**, who helps drive off the snakes. After the battle, the ranger reveals himself as **Vutha**, a **lizardfolk ranger**. He descends from the trees and states that he is friendly. Vutha explains that he is currently from **Omar**, but originally hails from **Llorgh**. His people were **driven from the island by the Goliath brothers**, and he seeks revenge, wishing them dead.

Vutha tells the party of **secret tunnels** leading to one of the Goliath brothers’ training grounds. From there, another hidden passage leads near **Grudrack’s location**, presenting an opportunity to ambush him. The party decides to trust Vutha, though **Obold remains uneasy**, harboring a deep distrust of lizardfolk.

Vutha leads the party to a **secluded area of forest near the tunnel entrances**, where they are able to complete a **long rest** undisturbed. Once rested, he guides them to a concealed stone entrance. Using a **hidden mechanism**, Vutha opens a stone door leading into the tunnels. **Thorin inspects the mechanism** and determines it to be a **weighted system** that automatically opens and closes the door.

As the party descends into the tunnels, they discover a **glyph carved into the stone wall**, written in **Draconic**, which reads:

> _“Beware the Gnawing One.”_

Deeper within the tunnels, the party notices **brown, circular holes** lining the walls. At irregular intervals, these openings erupt, releasing **bursts of sulfurous gas**. The party attempts to move through the hazard, but several members are harmed, suffering **minor damage and poisoning**. Upon reaching the bottom of a platform, the gas dissipates, and the party feels **subtle tremors**, as if the mountain itself is shifting.

Continuing downward, the party sees an **orange glow** ahead as the tunnel opens into a **massive cavern** with a vaulted ceiling. Looking upward approximately **800–900 feet**, the party sees **open sky** and realizes they are standing within the **mouth of a volcano**, roughly **300 feet in diameter**. Along the cavern walls, several **slow-moving rivers of magma** flow.

In the center of the cavern, the party observes **10–12 humanoid figures** huddled around something. As the party approaches, the figures look up, their eyes reflecting a **reddish glow**, before scattering in all directions. These creatures are revealed to be **rat-like humanoids**.

Across the cavern, a **dragon with glowing red eyes** watches from its perch.

Vutha speaks in Draconic, saying:

> _“We mean you no harm. We are here to liberate the island. We are here to help you.”_

The dragon spreads its wings, revealing itself as a **creature of rot, decay, and vermin**—a dragon bound to rats and filth. It replies in Draconic:

> _“How can you help me? What do you have, other than meat for my young?”_

When asked what it desires, the dragon answers simply:

> _“Meat. For my young.”_

As the party deliberates, the dragon takes flight, and at that moment the **ratfolk begin their attack**.

A fierce battle erupts between the party, the ratfolk, and the dragon. As ratfolk are slain, some burst apart, spawning **swarms of baby spiders**. The rat dragon repeatedly attempts **tail whip attacks**, but fails to land a single hit. However, her **breath weapon** proves devastating, badly injuring the party and knocking **Vutha into death saving throws**.

The battle ends when **Thorin delivers the final blow**, striking the dragon as it swoops in for another attack, killing it mid-flight.

## Log
The party tries to take a short rest, during which obold gifts Gunther Thavracks glaive. it is interupted at the end by an attack of snakes. During the attack the party gets helps from an unknown ranger. After the fight, a lizardfolk ranger descends from a tree and says he is friendly. he claims he is from omar but originally form llorgh. His people were kicked off the island by the goliath brothers and he wants them dead. 

He tells us of secret passages that lead to one of the goliath brothers training grounds, which then leads to a scret passage near where Grudrack is located,, and that we could potentially ambush him using the tunnels. THe party decides to trust him, though obold doesnt fully as he doesnt like lizards. 

He takes us to a secluded area in the forest near the tunnel; entrances where the party successfully takes a long rest. He then takes us to the entrance of a tunnel, uses a secret mechanism to open a a stone door that leads to the tunnels. Thorin inspects it and sees its a weighted mechanism that opens and closes the door. 

As the party descends into the cave, we read a glyph scarred into the wall that says, "beware the gnawing one" written in draconic. 

As the party is going into the cave, we see brown circular holes in the wall that seem to explode and release a sulfurous gas of some every so often. 

The party tried to pass the sulfurous bursts, but are not able to get away unscathed, with multiple members being slightly damaged and poisoned . we get to the bottom of a platform, the poison releases now that we are no longer in the gas. The party can feel small tremors and shifting of the mountain. 

As we descend, we see an orange glow where we are heading and the caves expands into a giant cavern with a vaulted cavern ceiling that expands upwards. As we look up 800-900 ft abouve us we see open sky. The party realizes we are now looking up at the mouth of the volcano. the diameter of the opening appears to be about 300'

off to the side we see  afew rivers of liquid magma, slowly moving. We see milling about in the center of the cavern, there are about 10-12 humanoids huddled over something, and they look up, we see a reddish reflection in their eyes. as they see us, they quickly seperate in all directions. 

As we enter the scene, we see a bunch of rat-like humans running around, and across the cavern we see a dragon posted up with red eyes. 

Vutha, speaking in draconic, says "we mean you no harm, we are here to liberate the island, we are here to help you".

As the dragon extends its wings, we can tell this is a dragon of rot, decay, of rats, it replies, "how can you help me, what do you have other than meat for my young " *in draconic* . 

Vutha asks it what it desires, to which she replies "meat, for my young"

She raises her wings as the party deliberates, flies in the air, and the ratfolk begin attacking.

The party begins to fight her and the rats. as we slay the rats, some of them die and spawn a large group of baby spiders. The rat dragon tried to tail whip us many times but missed every single time. Her breathe weapon on the other hand, damaged many of us, bringing down Vutha to death saving throws. 

Thorin dealt the final blow, bringing down the dragon as it swooped in to attack, and he got the opportunity to smack it on the way out.
