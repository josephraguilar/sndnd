## Session Summary
> [!tldr] [[campaign/sessions/031 01-18-2026\|031 01-18-2026]]
> The party explored a magma-scarred cavern and uncovered the remains of a rat dragon’s grisly hoard, recovering valuable currency, relics, and several powerful magic items. Guided by Vutha, they pushed deeper toward the Cradle of Smoke, narrowly avoiding disaster by cleverly pacifying and freeing a chained owlbear. Using the owlbear’s rampage as cover, the party stormed the training grounds and engaged Lazrack’s forces in a brutal battle against trainees and witches. Despite heavy spell pressure and multiple party members falling, the group prevailed through coordination and sheer force, ending the session with Obold restraining the final hag.

> The party is ambushed by snakes during a short rest, but is aided by **Vutha**, a lizardfolk ranger seeking revenge against the Goliath brothers who drove his people from Llorgh. Trusting his knowledge of hidden tunnels, the party follows him beneath the island, navigating poisonous gas traps and ominous warnings carved into the stone. Their descent leads into the mouth of a volcano, where they confront a dragon of rot and vermin commanding ratfolk minions. After a brutal battle that nearly claims Vutha’s life, the party slays the dragon and secures passage deeper into the island’s secrets.

## AI Summary
### Cavern & Hoard

The cavern contains a large central pile, with walls coated in hardened magma and basalt. Along the rear of the cavern—where the rat dragon was nesting—we find a hoard of sorts, with bits of shiny material visible throughout.

Gunther approaches and activates his magical awareness. He detects green alloys, various gems, and other items mixed among the remains. As we draw closer, Gunther senses **four magical items** within the hoard.

It becomes clear that this was not a typical gold-hoarding dragon. Instead, the creature hoarded bones and remains, melting bodies with its poisonous breath. It appeared far more interested in meat and corpses than treasure; most of the items seem to be incidental remnants taken from the bodies it consumed.

### Loot Collected

- The party recovers **5 gold bars**.
    
- Vutha gathers **93 obsidian hexagons**, a form of currency used by the lizardfolk of Oman.
    
- Each party member collects **5 obsidian trade tokens**.
    
- The party also recovers **gems worth ____**.
    

**Notable Items (Non-magical):**

- Alias finds an **8-inch-long block of fossilized driftwood**, carved into the shape of a lizard with its tail extended. The piece features **gold inlay**.
    
- Louis finds a **ceremonial gold crown**, adorned with **bone spines and emerald scales**.
    

### Magical Items Identified

1. **Spear of the Drowned Fang**
    
    - A barbed spear made of blackened bone and obsidian
        
    - +1 spear
        
    - Once per turn, deals an additional **1d4 poison damage**
        
    - If thrown into water or swamp terrain, it **returns to the wielder’s hand**
        
2. **Scale Plate of the Brood Guard**
    
    - +1 scale mail
        
    - Crafted from ancient crocodilian and dragon scales
        
    - Grants **advantage on saving throws against poison**
        
    - Counts as **non-metal** (druid-friendly)
        
3. **Shield of Gnawed Stone**
    
    - Heavy shield made of stone and bone
        
    - +1 shield
        
    - Once per day, reduce incoming damage by **1d8 + Constitution modifier**
        
4. **Rat King Torque**
    
    - A warped, gnawed gold neck ring
        
    - Grants **advantage on Stealth checks in underground environments**
        
    - Imposes **disadvantage on Persuasion checks with civilized humanoids**

### Toward the Cradle of Smoke

Vutha believes he knows the location of the **Cradle of Smoke**, the training grounds for Lazrack’s trainees. The party follows him deeper into the cave system.

Before resting, Obold summons **Ramses V**. The party then takes a **long rest** in the tunnels.

After resting, we proceed deeper with Vutha leading. We encounter a sealed passage and search for a mechanism to open it. Vutha locates a lever and opens the passage, using **Pass Without Trace** on himself, Alias, and Kaneko.

---

### The Owlbear Chamber

Vutha drops into a cavern below and discovers an **owlbear chained to the wall**. Gunther quickly pulls Vutha back just as the owlbear lunges at him, though the creature is restrained by a massive metal chain. To continue onward, the party must pass by the owlbear.

Ophie attempts to calm the creature by feeding it **Goodberries**. The owlbear eats them and approaches her, but is stopped short by the chain.

As Ramses enters the room, the owlbear swipes at him. Obold leaps in, retrieves Ramses, and retreats to safety. The owlbear recognizes Obold as someone who has previously assaulted it and flies into a rage. However, as the rest of the party enters, the creature backs away, wary of being attacked again.

While the party moves toward the far door, Obold offers the owlbear more Goodberries as a peace offering. He succeeds in calming it, distracting the creature long enough for the party to pass through the door.

---

### The Cradle of Smoke

Beyond the door, we observe:

- **20 trainee half-goliaths**
    
- **Two cedar witches**
    
- **One large goliath**
    

The party retreats back into the owlbear chamber, where the creature is currently semi-friendly.

Those with keen hearing overhear one of the witches say, _“Do you smell something?”_ The party realizes the witches can smell our **tainted blood**.

---

### Releasing the Owlbear

The party retreats to the corner of the room with the owlbear. Obold continues to feed it Goodberries while maneuvering behind it. He then uses **Z’daria** to break the chain binding the creature.

Realizing it is free, the owlbear charges through the doorway into the Cradle of Smoke. The party follows immediately behind it.

---

### The Battle

A brutal fight erupts. The owlbear charges ahead, splitting the enemies and dealing massive damage before it sees its opening and flees. Many enemies cast **Command** on party members, while a hag rains spells down from afar. Vutha and Kaneko dispatch her so quickly that the party is stunned.

Another hag turns invisible and begins casting from the shadows. During the chaos, both **Gunther and Louis fall**, though Gunther remains in the fight through sheer orcish resilience.

Thorin eventually brings down **Lazrack** with a devastating kidney shot. Alias weaves through the melee, striking enemies with deadly precision. Ophie deals heavy damage in bear form but fails a leap off a cliff, turning invisible—either from embarrassment or self-preservation.

A third hag appears, only to be swiftly killed by the party.

Finally, Obold—mounted on Ramses V—charges the last hag as she reveals herself. After Thorin successfully casts **Hold Person**, Obold restrains her and begins choking her.

**The session ends here.**

Vutha believes he knows where we can come upon the [[Cradle of Smoke\|Cradle of Smoke]] which is the training grounds for [[campaign/npcs/Lazrack\|Lazrack]]s trainees. We follow Vutha into the cave, and we go to take a long rest in the tunnel, Obold summons Ramses V before the rest.We take a long rest in the cave. 

we travel further up the cave after our rest, with Vutha leading. we come across a closed passage and we look for a lever of some sort to open it. Vutha finds the lever and opens it, using pass without trace on him, alias, and Kaneko. 

Vutha drop into the cavern, and see an owlbear tied to the wall. Gunther pulls him out of the cave, right as he was about to get mauled, however, the owlbear was tied to a big metal chain. that stopped it from going further. to proceed past this area, we need to pass by the owlbear. 

Ophie tries to feed it good berries, and it eats them and walks toward her but the chain stops it form going further. 

Ramses takes a swipe as he enters the room. Obold jumps in and runs with Ramses to safety and the Owlbear recognizes him as one of the people of whom assault him often and goes crazy. as the rest of the party enters the owlbear backs away scared that we might hurt it. The party goes for the door as Obold tries to offer the owlbear some more goodberries as a peace offering. 
He succeeds in his persuasion and gives the owlbear some good berries, distracting it while the party goes through the door on the other side of the room.

We see 20 small trainee half goliaths and two cedar witches, and one large goliath.

the party comes back into the room with Obold and the Owlbear, who is semi-friendly at the moment. 

The keen of hearing hear one of the witches say, "Do you smell something?" The party realizes that the witches smell our tainted blood. 

The party goes back into the corner of the room with the owlbear, Obold uses the goodberries to continue to tame the owlbear as he walks around behind it. He then uses Z'daria to break the chain its on freeing it. It realizes its freedom and charges through the door into the Cradle of Smoke Training Guard, the party charging behind it. 

A brutal fight breaks out with many of the enemies casting command on us. The owlbear deals massive damage and spits the front line, eventually fleeing the battle once it sees an opening.  The hag rains spell down on us from afar, but Vutha and Kaneko dispatches her so quick the party could hardly believe it. Another hag goes invisible and begins casting spells from the shadows. Both Gunther and Lois fall at some point in the battle, but through orcish brute force, Gunther stays in the mix. Thorin eventually brings down the [[campaign/npcs/Lazrack\|Lazrack]] with a kidney shot. Alias weaves in and out of the mix, stabbing foes left and right. Ophie does damage in a bear form, but fails at leaping off a cliff and goes invisible in embarrassment/to protect herself. Another hag appears, only to get quickly killed by the party. Obold, riding his trusty steed Ramses V, rushes the final hag after she appears, and after Thorin is able to cast hold person on her, he begins to hold her up and choke her. The session ends here.
