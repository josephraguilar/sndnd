## AI Summary
The party arrived at the **Wanton Witch**, where they met **Lila**, the barkeep. They learned that “**The Dancer**” appears during the **Parade of Slaves**, a grand event held whenever new slaves arrive in the city. Curious, [[campaign/players/Lois\|Lois]] and [[campaign/players/Ophie\|Ophie]] visited a magic shop tied to **Kalista** and met **Fiyel Lok**, who revealed the names of _The Three_ hags — **Wicked Ursula Worm Wiggle**, **Rotten Agnis Worm Wiggle**, and **Driftwood Ulga Worm Wiggle** — warning them never to speak the names aloud.

At the **Parade of Slaves** before the **Temple of the High Cleric**, the party observed each slave group marked by different colored cloths. The tyrant [[campaign/npcs/Arch Bishop Corin Mag\|Arch Bishop Corin Mag]] sat upon a throne, flanked by powerful allies including the hag **Olga** and her servant **Dominica**. The party also spotted **Slack** and [[campaign/npcs/Cylia Liaric\|Cylia Liaric]] among the onlookers. When Corn Mag released Cilia, she began to dance, mesmerizing the entire crowd — everyone except [[campaign/players/Ophie\|Ophie]]. Using the distraction, Arch Bishop Corin Mag purchased a beautiful human slave and had her taken away.

Later, the group deciphered passages in the [[campaign/items/Galdrabrock\|Galdrabrock]], learning infernal commands to control the collars:

- “**Kraga Opinn**” – open the collar
- “**Kraga Loka**” – close the collar
- “**Kraga Lokadu < name > Nuna Og Vertu Bundin**” – seize control of the wearer

The party then traveled toward [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Gloomshadow Hill\|Gloomshadow Hill]], passing a massive statue of  **Gollum** and a hidden library beneath the West Gate. They met **Kira**, who demanded the Galdrabrock. Though the party considered betrayal, her show of force — fifty thieves — made resistance impossible. She led them to a concealed passage under the temple, ending in a small library. There, Kira told them they were on their own. Her intel suggested that the Dancer was held below, across **three temple levels**.

Within the library, a follower of **Iuz** overheard them; they silenced him before reinforcements arrived but were soon detected again, forcing a battle in the main hall. Afterward, they discovered that the books they sought had recently been removed — only dusty outlines remained.

Delving deeper, they uncovered a **treasure room**, carefully looted it, and claimed vast riches — paintings, gold, and thousands of emeralds and sapphires. Continuing onward, they entered a lavish **bedchamber**. Inside stood a **mirror that reflected a different reality**, and a **ceremonial dagger** lay upon the bed. On one nightstand sat a bowl with a thousand gemstones; on the other, an identical empty one. When they took the gems, the **door vanished**, leaving only solid stone where it once stood.

## Log
The party arrives at the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Wanton Witch\|Wanton Witch]] and are greeted by [[campaign/npcs/Lila\|Lila]], the barkeep.
They are told that "The Dancer" participates in the parade of slaves. The parade of slaves is a march the slavers do when a new shipment of slaves comes in to show off the current selection of slaves. 
Louis and Ofie go to a magic shop that is connected to Kalista and meet [[campaign/npcs/Fiyel Lok\|Fiyel Lok]] where she told them the names of [[campaign/factions/The Three\|The Three]] hags,
- [[campaign/npcs/Wicked Ursula Worm Wiggle\|Wicked Ursula Worm Wiggle]]
- [[campaign/npcs/Rotten Agnis Worm Wiggle\|Rotten Agnis Worm Wiggle]]
- [[campaign/npcs/Driftwood Ulga Worm Wiggle\|Driftwood Ulga Worm Wiggle]]
Fiyel told them it was not good to say their names out loud. 

The party then embarked to go see the parade of slaves after learning that it takes place in front of the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Temple of the high Cleric\|Temple of the high Cleric]]. 

Watching the parade the party notices that each group of slaves has a different color cloth. Corin Mag is seated at a throne and is surrounded by powerful people. One of the three is sitting next to him and it appears to be Ulga. She has behind her the Shag Dominica. Another hag is near her as well. The party did see slack there and they also saw Cilia is there. Corin Mag unchains her and she begins to dance and everybody seems to be mesmerized by her in the crowd as well as in the party everyone except for Opie. Corin Mag uses this time of entrancement to talk with a slaver and he pays to get a beautiful human woman slave who then becomes taken away. 

The party Reads the Galdrabrock and learn how to open the collars that are on the slaves.

The party then heads to Gloomshadow hill and passes by a large statue call to Gollum and a library Under the West gate on the Kings Road to gloom shadow Hill. The party considered betraying [[campaign/npcs/Kira\|Kira]] but she had a show of force and had 50 thieves with her so we didn't have a choice but hand over the book. We then met her at the gate of a wall that leads into the temple it was a secret passageway that they knew of. On that wall there was a trap door that led into a tunnel that led us into the temple. At the end of the tunnel was a ladder which we went up and put us into a library Kira told us we were on our own at that point. According to Kira's sources the dancer was below the temple and that there were three different levels of the temple. Once we enter this small library we were heard by one of the followers of Iuz Who we then killed before he lured the others we tried to sneak across to a separate separate library that we wanted to get to but it got noticed on our way. The party got into a fight in the main hall and afterwards went to the library that was supposed to have the books that we were in search of. The books looked as though they had been sitting in a certain spot for a long time as there was dust outlining their original positions but they were not there anymore We decided to go deeper into the temple to find the dancer and hopefully the books. On the way in we found a room full of treasure and after carefully checking for traps we decided it actually was a storeroom and took many paintings and lots of gold and gems. The party took of about 1000 emeralds a 1000 Lots of sapphires and lots of gold. The team doubled back from that room as it seemed to be a dead end and took a different turn and ended up in what appeared to be a room that belonged to a very wealthy or important person. There was a mirror that seemed to reflect something different than what was reality A ceremonial dagger on a bed on one side of the bed was a night stand with a 1000 gemstones and the other side was an empty bowl that looked the same. After taking the gemstones from the bow the door in which the party had walked in from disappeared and it seemed there was just stone where the door had originally been.
