## Log
We decided to rest. While resting, we were attacked by orcs. During the battle, Grolgrath revealed that they were members of the BlackMaw tribe. [[campaign/npcs/Garkul\|Garkul]], their chieftain, led the attack.

As the fight ended, we walked down a path lined with bone arches and stumbled into a portal leading to a dark, nether-like realm. Moments later, we were transported again—this time to a lush, green region beneath a lavender sky.

Traveling down a nearby path, we met a talking tortle named **[[campaign/npcs/Tumblegrit\|Tumblegrit]]**, who said he would take us to the **Hollow Court**. Upon arrival, we were accused of an unknown crime. [[campaign/players/Gunther\|Gunther]] reveals some of his past to the party on the way to the court. Gunther is accused of slaying 4 members of the [[campaign/factions/Green Court\|Green Court]] Gunther spoke for us, and I vouched for him.

The fey presiding over the court summoned a bard who was slain before he could sing.  This was a vision of someon Gunther had slain. we are shown another vision of a knight that Grunthor had supposedly killed. 
Finally, the fey revealed her name — **[[campaign/npcs/Lady Thistledawn\|Lady Thistledawn]]**.

We soon discovered that we could no longer remember our names or even each other’s names. Lady Thistledawn tasked us with journeying to **the [[campaign/locations/Echo Tree\|Echo Tree]]** so that we could earn our names back.

Before leaving, we traded with Tumblegrit and  Kormack traded for a locket that cannot be opened while you remember the name of the person who gave it to you. Kormack handed the locket to Gunthor, who then returned it to Kormack so that they could open it together. Inside was a second piece to a map leading to the **Promised Land**, matching one we had previously found in [[campaign/npcs/Zorath the Veilbinder\|Zorath the Veilbinder]]'s tower.

With our task complete, we regained our names and traveled back to the Ogre Wastelands.
