> After defeating Archbishop Corin Mag and retrieving several dark tomes, the party learned shocking truths about Salyx, Thexus, and Zae’s relationship. Amid a massive battle outside the temple, they escaped in a hijacked wagon, barely surviving a fiery pursuit. They regrouped at the docks with Irlan Liaric aboard _The Bitch’s Scorn_—joined by the surprising reappearance of Kalista.

## AI Summary
After departing aboard _The Bitch’s Scorn_, the party learned from Irlan and Cylia Liaric that they needed passage to Waterdeep. Kalista revealed her true identity as the fiancée of the Betrayer King, a once-tyrannical ruler who helped _The Three_ rise to power but now fights against them. The group faced a difficult choice between journeying to Llorgh to avenge Obold’s mother or to Velen to rescue Thorin’s daughter, Vista. Believing his mother already dead, Obold supported saving Vista, and the party set course for Waterdeep, planning to stop in Velen afterward. En route, they encountered an undead pirate ship where Thorin was briefly possessed by its ghostly captain before the party subdued him. Skipping the lure of treasure on Mintarin Island, they pressed onward until a massive Aboleth attacked, tearing a hole in their ship and forcing an emergency landing on Mintarin for repairs.

## Log
 [[campaign/npcs/Irlan Liaric\|Irlan Liaric]] and [[campaign/npcs/Cylia Liaric\|Cylia Liaric]] tell us that they need to be dropped off in [[campaign/locations/4_cities_islands/Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]]

We learned that the [[campaign/npcs/Betrayer King\|Betrayer King]] is [[campaign/npcs/Kalista\|Kalista]]'s fiance and that Kalista was disguising herself earlier. As she revealed herself, the party sees that she in younger beautiful woman. We learned that the betrayer king once helped [[campaign/factions/The Three\|The Three]] come to power and allowed slavery, but has now changed his ways and fights against them. 

The party has to make a decision between going to [[campaign/locations/4_cities_islands/Llorgh\|Llorgh]] as they promised to [[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] to get vengeance on his father for he has likely slain  Obold's mother. [[campaign/players/Thorin\|Thorin]] needs to go to [[campaign/locations/2_regions & archipelagos/Velen\|Velen]] because his daughter is caught up in the slave trade there that is currently run by orc clans. 

The party decides to go to Velen as Obold believes in his heart that his mother is dead, and there is still a good chance that we can save Thorin's daughter [[campaign/npcs/Vista\|Vista]] .

The party sets off to Waterdeep. We are told that we will pass an island called [[campaign/locations/4_cities_islands/Mintarin\|Mintarin]]. [[campaign/players/Alias\|Alias]] remembers that it is said to have great treasure, but it is also home to a dangerous monstrosity. 

On the way the party fends off an attack from an undead ship. During the attack Thorin was possessed by a pirate captain's ghost. we had to knock him unconscious in order to release the spirits hold on him. ** I sure hope that's the last we see of him** 👀

The party began to pass Mintarin and agreed that time was of the essence to save Vista, so we decided not to look for treasure this time. Unfortunately, a giant [[campaign/monsters/Aboleth\|Aboleth]] rammed our ship, knocking a whole in the side. The party was able to fend it off, but needed to emergency land on Mintarin to repair the hole. We barely made it ashore and are now on the island of Mintarin
