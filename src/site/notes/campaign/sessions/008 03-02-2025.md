## Log
The party approaches the [[campaign/locations/2_regions & archipelagos/Cloud Peak Mountains\|Cloud Peak Mountains]] range. The landscape changes from forest to a more chaparral region. We reach the hills and had towards the mountains. We a massive bark wall with glowing fungus at its base, surrounding a large tower. The tower has some candlelight coming from some windows, and the top of the tower is a green leafy canopy, almost as if the tower is a large magical tree. Glyphs are carved into the wooed of the towers and walls. Roots create an archway leading into the entrance of the tree-like tower. The glyphs appear t be ancient druidic and [[campaign/players/Ophie\|Ophie]] is able to read them. They say "Beware, you are entering the domain of the Veilbinder". (nerd). Ophie touches the entrance & the wood pulls back and opens for her. 

Once we enter the bottom chamber we see 3 pedestals, each with a chest on them. On the back wall atop some stairs is a door similar to the one we just walked in through. The chests ask us 3 riddles. We got two right, and the last one wrong, at which point they turn into mimics and attack us. The party defeats them and moves onto the next room

The next room is a grand library with 3 ghostly librarians inside. One of the ghosts asks us to prove our wisdom in order to move on. We need to select the correct tome for them to let us pass. We correctly select [[campaign/items/The Balance of Life and Death The Burning of the Cycle\|The Balance of Life and Death The Burning of the Cycle]]. 

The next room was fill of vials and was some kid of alchemy lab. there was a glowing cauldron filled with swirling liquid. We decide the final ingredient to the potion, and when we do 3 elementals attack us. We defeat them and get a potion of resist fire. We then head up a staircase to the top level of the tower. Once we enter we feel powerful magic. The ceiling looked like the night sky underneath the canopy of the tree like structure. 

Zorath appeared, he was a human with emerald eyes. He said something along the lines of "the veil binds all things". We fought with him and Obold ended up getting the killing blow. we looted 3 large gems, a potion of greater healing, and a potion of speed.  We also took his amulet, and got the [[campaign/items/Veilbinders Staff\|Veilbinders Staff]]
