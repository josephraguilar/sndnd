## AI Summary
The party executed a carefully planned ambush on the goliath-controlled farmland, beginning with Ophie summoning eight wolves to sow chaos along one side of the fields. Their intent was precise: frighten the farmers, drive women and children to safety, and draw the goliath fighters away from the homesteads. As the wolves howled and surged forward, the plan worked—noncombatants fled for cover while goliaths and half-goliaths rushed to defend the pens. Complications arose when some of the defenders turned out to be women, causing the wolves—following Ophie’s exact orders—to hesitate. After several wolves were cut down, Ophie amended the command, unleashing them fully once the innocents were confirmed safe.

With the defenders distracted, Obold led the charge atop his fiendish goat, Ramses IV, crashing into the fray and grievously wounding a goliath on impact. As battle erupted across the fields, Ophie focused on opening pens and gates, freeing goats and later cattle that thundered through the fight in panicked herds. Gunther joined Obold in a furious rage, poisoning nearby enemies, while Thorin devastated the battlefield with fire, guiding bolts, brutal headbutts, and precise strikes. Kaneko harried the rear lines with deadly accuracy, Alias weaved through combat dispatching foes with surgical speed, and Lois bombarded the goliaths from afar with eldritch blasts—one of the few sources of reliable magical damage in the melee.

The battle intensified into a sprawling, chaotic mosh pit as more goliaths joined the fray. Ophie eventually abandoned subtlety altogether,  tearing into enemies directly in her wolf form. In the midst of the chaos, Obold realized one of the goliaths was his uncle, Thavrak. The fight took a decisive turn when Kormak, guided by foresight, used suggestion to compel Thavrak to hurl his weapons away. Thorin followed with a powerful hold person, locking multiple goliaths in place. Ophie brutally executed one of the paralyzed foes, Alias and Thorin finished the rest, and Thavrak was left isolated.

Thavrak attempted to flee multiple times—throwing Gunther aside and scrambling for weapons—but Obold and the party relentlessly pursued him. Though Gunther’s thrown axe critically struck Thavrak, inadvertently rearming him, the escape was short-lived. With a final command, Obold forced his uncle back. Surrounded and broken, Thavrak collapsed to his knees. When Obold demanded to know Kaela’s fate, Thavrak claimed she still lived, imprisoned with Grudrak in the volcano. Calling him a liar, Obold delivered the killing blow, ending his uncle’s life.

In the aftermath, Obold claimed Thavrak’s glaive—scarred with forty notches, each marking a memorable taking of life. The party gathered the surviving townsfolk and sent them safely toward the port city, making clear they bore no hatred for the innocent. Before razing the farms and village, Obold demanded all icons, scriptures, and idols of Iuz be piled in the center of town. The party burned them together, leaving nothing behind but ash, smoke, and the echoes of a faith rejected.

## Log
The party decides to have Ophie create 8 wolves to create havoc on oneside of the farmlang and not attack the women and children. The party fans out amongst the nearest tree-line awaiting a time to strike the distracted goliaths. 
The wolves approach and start howling loudly to startle the farmers. The women and children rush back to the houses for protection while the half goliaths and goliaths go to defend the farmland. The wolves go in and refrain from attacking the female goliaths, because the party didnt realize some of the fighters would be women, and the wolves are following direct orders. 

As this is happening the party is approaching, with obold leading ahead top Ramses IV.

Three of the wolves are quickly dispatched. Ophie changes her order to attack anyone now that the (human) woman and children are safe. 

Obold Charges in atop his Fiendish Goat Ramses, severely injuring one of the goliaths. Ophie continues to use her wolves to try and open the gates. succeeding in opening one of the fences and freeing a bunch of Goats. Gunther comes to aid Obold, raging and causing anyone around him to take poison damage. Thorin comes in and firebolts one of the goliaths for massive damage, and headbutts the other to get its attention. Kaneko joins as well, dealing good damage to one in the rear of the fight. Ophie continues to set animals free, this time, the herd of cows begin running throughout the fight. Obold and Gunther become entangled in a fight with 3 of the Goliaths, but thankfully, Captain Alias comes ton their aid, stabbing and running around them, weaving in and out of the fight. Luis begins Eldritch blasting the goliaths, doing good damage as she is one of the only of the party who can do magic damage. Obold cleaves clean through one of the goliaths directly into the other.  Thorin joins the fray of obold and gunther, punching one of the female goliaths in the kidneys. Thorin then starts guiding bolting the goliaths he is fighting to deal maximum damage. Thorin stabs one of the goliaths he is fighting with a poison blade, petrifying her and killing her instantly, he then runs and headbutts the next goliath in his area. He is now on his own fighting two female goliaths while the party fights the rest. Kaneko was solo'd out by a goliath. He ran towards Lois, taking an opportunity attack. The goliath he was on the joined the fray of Gunther, Goliath, Thorin and the two other goliaths, now making them be surrounded by three enemies. Another goliath chased down Thorin, which now brings the fighting frenzy to 7 total combatants, with Alias weaving in and out, and Lois eldritch blasting from afar. While this entire fight has been happening up to this point, one of Ophie's wolves has been trying to free a pen of pigs and failing miserably. 

Ophie then joins the mosh pit as a wolf and starts rippin n tearin. Obold realizes in the middle of the fight that the Goliath that chased down Kaneko is his uncle Thavrak. Now that Kaneko is now face-to-face with a Goliath, he starts letting arrows fly into the fight. 

Kormak, in s stroke of GENIUS, uses suggestion to make Thavrak throw his weapons behind hi as far as he could, and knew that he would because he foresaw the outcome as a portent.  Thorin then uses a high level spell to cast hold person, immobilizing two of the three goliaths in the maelstrom most of the party is in. 

Thavrack, without his weapons, picked up and threw Gunther away from the fight and tried to flee to rgab his weapons. As he tried to flee, Obold, filled with familial anger, critically struck Thavrack, pinning him to the ground as a sentinel, and screamed, "WHERE ARE YOU GOING OLD MAN!?".  Ophie's ripped out the achilles heel off one of the held Goliaths, killing them immediately. Alias dives in to quickly dispatch the reamining goliath in the mosh pit, leaving only Thavrack surrounded by our party. 

While this is happening, Kormak is keeping 3 female goliaths hands full. Ophie came in to assist Kormack. Thavrak throws gunther again, and tries to flee, Obold misses his sentinel attack. Obold and gunther chase him down, Gunther throws his axe and critically strikes him, sticking his axe in between his shoulder blades, which unfortunately gave him a weapon.

Kaneko Snipes one of the goliaths fighting Kormak and Ophie. Steelbeak swoops in and kills one of the other Goliaths in that same area. Thorin, critically strikes a goliath with his guiding bolt, and smacks her with his hammer, killing her.  Thavrack tries to flee again, but obold held the command spell, yelling "get back over here!" 

The party brings down Thavrak eventually, bringing him to his knees. He grips Obolds leg in desperation. Obold asks him if he knows if Kaela is alive and where she is. He says she lives and is with Grudrack in the Volcano, to which Obold exclaims, "YOU LIE!" Kicking the axe into Thavraks back, fully impaling him and killing him. 

Obold takes Thavracks Glaive that he used for farming and for battle. It had 40 notches in it, each representing a meaningful slaying for him. 

The party gathers the townfolk and sends them to the port city, as they mean the women and children no harm, they cannot stay there as thet must raze the farms and town. Before they leave, Obold asks the townsfolk to gather all of their images, scriptures, statues, or other idolic belongings of Iuz and place them in the center of the village, where the party burned them.
