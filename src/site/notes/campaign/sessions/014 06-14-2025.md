## Log
We engage Vrax Sithra in a brutal fight and manage to slay the spider Matriarch. She appears to have been some kind of **twisted dwarven experiment**, according to [[campaign/players/Kormak\|Kormak]]'s examination of the remains.

After the battle, we climb out of [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Kund Vethrak\|Kund Vethrak]] and rest at the campsite outside the mine. The next day, we resume our journey south toward the [[campaign/factions/Black Maw Tribe\|Black Maw Tribe]]'s mining territory, where we believe Thorin’s daughters may be located.

As we travel, we encounter something called an **Ash Storm** — a dark, choking tempest of ash and embers. [[campaign/npcs/Grolgath\|Grolgath]] warns that it is dangerous and urges us to find shelter. After pressing through the storm for some time, we come across a **farmhouse**…

### T**he Farmhouse**

The house was barely standing. **Grolgrath** knocked on the door, and a **half-orc** answered, offering us his hospitality so long as we remained respectful. Inside, we met a **female half-orc**, another **large orc man**, and a **small gnome** who appeared completely out of place — covered in ash and soot.

The gnome introduced himself as [[campaign/npcs/Tibit\|Tibit]], a tinkerer and gem-crafter who made contraptions for his travels. He mentioned he was headed toward [[campaign/locations/2_regions & archipelagos/Calimshan\|Calimshan]], a dwarven city.

The house was owned by [[campaign/npcs/Grusksa\|Grusksa]], the female half-orc. The two orcs with her were her guardians. Though not part of any specific clan, they served as **gravekeepers for all orcish clans** in the region.

### **The Graveyard**

That night, while we slept, Tibit snuck out to the nearby **graveyard**, searching for “something shiny.” His meddling awakened a **giant undead guardian** that protected the graves.
