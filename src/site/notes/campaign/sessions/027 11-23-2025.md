## Session Summary
> [!tldr] [[campaign/sessions/027 11-23-2025\|027 11-23-2025]]
> The party parlayed with a Gwynneth ship and learned the true history of King Ardyn, the so-called Betrayer King, as well as the locations of the Galdur Towers. Arriving at Llorgh, they searched for information about Obold’s past and learned of growing tensions, fewer Veruz Rexna arrivals, and increased Uganathi activity. While traveling toward the goliath encampment, they were ambushed by raptors and defeated them, executing their dire scale brute leader. The group continued toward the volcano’s forest to rest.

> After days of sailing through storms, ghostly fog, and strange sea creatures, the crew reaches Baldur’s Gate. They deliver a cursed relic — the Whispering Reliquary — to Knifebloom of the Dark Daggers in a secret chamber beneath a bathhouse. The relic contains the tongue of an orcish seer tied to a dark prophecy of Gruumsh’s rise. The party leaves the city richer in gold and knowledge, though uneasy about the power they helped deliver.

## AI Summary
The party continued its sea voyage, passing another ship without issue and noting the names of their own ship’s workers: Tom, Dick, Stanley, Gaston, and Lapoo. After safely navigating a storm, they spotted three landmasses to the north on Day 10. Kormak sighted a mysterious fog-colored ship bearing a flag with an oak tree wrapped in kraken-like limbs—identified by Ophie as the flag of Gwynneth. The vessel turned toward them and raised a parlay flag, so the party kept their Baldur’s Gate flag hoisted despite Lois and Obold wanting to fly the Baphomet flag.

The approaching ship featured a wyvern-headed prow, and its crew wore gray-blue clothing and dark blue cloaks. During parlay, the party met Captain Trefelger (“Captain Tref”), who explained that Gwynneth once rivaled Llorgh and opposes anyone aligned with “the Three.” He gave them a parchment labeling them as allies of the Betrayer King and revealed lore about the Galdur Towers—three powerful structures held by the Three: one on Oman’s Isle, one under the sea, and one in the Underdark.

Tref recounted the true story of King Ardyn Maelwyn ap Rhodri. Once known as the compassionate Bright Prince of Gwynneth, he fell victim to a deception by Auntie Rhemmy, who fabricated and disguised herself as his bride-to-be, Rihanna Starsong. Upon uncovering the truth, Ardyn called off the marriage, and Rhemmy cursed him as “the Betrayer King.” He embraced the name, vowing to betray evil rather than serve darkness. The party parted amicably with Captain Tref, who acknowledged having heard of the Scorned 8.

Reaching Llorgh, the party raised a Moonshae Isles flag and questioned villagers about Obold’s mother and past sacrifices, but no one knew anything. They learned that fewer ships from Veruz Rexna had arrived lately, and that the Uganathi Clan’s presence had increased. Rumors suggested that King Ardyn might be moving to take Alaron.

As the party traveled inland toward the goliath encampment near the volcano, the grasses grew tall enough to obscure their dwarven allies. Ophie and Kaneko detected clicking sounds—raptors. After scouting, the group was ambushed by a pack. Kaneko quickly killed the first, Lois unleashed a fireball that ignited the grass, and a battle ensued. Alias and Gunther were knocked down early, but the party ultimately defeated the raptors and their leader, a dire scale brute. Attempting negotiation, they offered the brute life in exchange for help, but when he proved uncooperative, Obold beheaded him. The party then moved toward the forest at the base of the volcano before resting.

## Log
The party passed a ship uneventfully.
We learned our ships workers names are
- [[Tom\|Tom]]
- [[Dick\|Dick]] 
- [[Stanley\|Stanley]] 
- [[Gaston\|Gaston]] 
- [[Lapoo\|Lapoo]]

We then passed through a storm unharmed. 

Mid day, day 10, we see 3 different land masses to the north. (we're headed west). Kormak then sees a ship headed towards us and sends out a bird to inspect it. He perceives that the ship looks the color of fog. its flag is that of an oak tree with kraken like legs entangling it. Ophie looks through her book of maps, and determines its the flag of the [[campaign/locations/Gwynneth\|Gwynneth]] . we see about 10 men on the deck. We then determine that the boat turns towards us. we decide to leave our [[campaign/locations/4_cities_islands/Baldurs Gate\|Baldurs Gate]] flag up, even though [[campaign/players/Lois\|Lois]] and [[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] wanted to put the [[campaign/npcs/Baphomet\|Baphomet]] flag up.

the ship approaches, the front looks like a wyverns descending head. The men on the dhip appear as if theyre wearing some grayish and blue clothes, their cloaks are long and dark blue. A couple have helmets but not all. The helms have a stylzed wasve cret. they have shortweords, javelins or spears. They are preparing to defend their ship, but dont look like theyre intending to board us. They put out a flag of parlay out, and begin a parlay with us. alias and gunther stand to the side and let alias approach the man in charge. His name is [[campaign/npcs/Trefelger\|Trefelger]], his mates call him captain Tref. we confirm they are from Gwynneth. Tref is surprised we don't know the history of the [[campaign/locations/Moonshae Isles\|Moonshae Isles]]. He informs us the island of llorgh was their rivals at one time, but since the goliaths took over the island and got rid of the lizard folk they are not enemies, but gwenth doesnt approve of what happens on llorgh and is enemies of anyone who is sided with the three. He hands us a parchment that says we are aligned with the betrayer king. he says one of the galdur towers is in the moonshae isles, the other is said to be under sea, and one to be in the underdark. The three each have one of the galdurs towers, which provide them their. We learn the one that is in the moonshae isles is in Oman's isle. We learn that the rack brothers are on the center of the island of llorgh. We learn that [[campaign/npcs/King Ardyn Maelwyn ap Rhodri\|King Ardyn Maelwyn ap Rhodri]]  is the king of Gwynneth, the bright prince of Gwynneth, aka THE BETRAYER KING. We learn that he was the one who was actually betrayed. Before he was the betrayer king, Ardyn was known as the bright prince of Gwynneth. A serious compassionate raised in [[Ryrath Forest\|Ryrath Forest]]. His early years he tried to unite the coastal clans of Gwynneth. He fell in love and had arranged a marriage with Rihanna Starsong. It was all a lie, she was a myth made by [[campaign/npcs/Auntie Rhemmy\|Auntie Rhemmy]], who tried 

Prince Ardyn noticed things were odd with Rihanna, and with an aid of circle of druids, he learned the truth and called off the wedding. He spurned her, so Auntie Rhemmy shrieked a curse across the isle, naming him the betrayer king. He embracedd it, saying "Better to be a betrayer of evil than a pawn of darkness". We part ways and tell him that if he sees the betrayer king to say the Scorned 8 (our party name) sends their regards, to which he replies that he has heard of us. 

We approach [[campaign/locations/4_cities_islands/Llorgh\|llorgh]] and map it our a bit., 

we put up a Moonshae isles flag.

we land on then island obold asks around for information on his mother or any sacrifices of the maidens. The villagers have not heard of anything. We ask where the goliath encampment is, we learn its toward the volcano. There have been less ships from [[campaign/factions/Veruz Rexna\|Veruz Rexna]] that have reached the island. another villagers says they have felt the presence of the [[campaign/factions/Uganathi Clan\|Uganathi Clan]] more often, as they come to drop off more paladins who are ready after training, but sometimes there is no one there to receive them. 

We learn [[campaign/npcs/King Ardyn Maelwyn ap Rhodri\|King Ardyn Maelwyn ap Rhodri]] is potentially taking over Alaron. 

We leave the village and get into a grassy area headed towards the central village where the Goliaths are. The grass begins to get higher, and gets to Obolds chest, and over the heads of our dwarven friends. Ophie and Kaneko hear a clicking or chirping sound and alert us. Kormak sends out his bird to investigate. It sees a reptilian, Kaneko shoots the firs one he sees three times and kills it instantly. Lois uses fireball and hits one, starting a grassland fire that begins growing. we see that they are raptors and we begin engaging them. alias and Gunther get knocked to the ground at the start. Alias accidentally flees into the leader of the group and was able to eventually get away (by Tymora's blessing) We eventually kill the lizards and defeat their leader a dire scale brute, which we tie up. Thorin casts tongues so we can understand him and ask him to aid us in our quest since he is also trying to kill goliaths. The lizard man says his queen rules the island of [[campaign/locations/Oman\|Oman]], but is controlled by the hag. We offer to let him live if he's helpful (after Throing threatened to torture him by the balls)., He politely declined so Obold beheaded him. The party then ventures forth towards the forest that lines the central volcano on the island before resting.
