## Log
While traveling with our wagons, we were ambushed by a group of orcs — members of the [[campaign/factions/Bloodfang Tribe\|Bloodfang Tribe]], the same clan that [[campaign/npcs/Grolgath\|Grolgath]] once belonged to. After defeating them, I spoke privately with Grolgrath about why he left the clan and the shame he carried from it. I told him he would always have a place with us, no matter his past.

Among the orcs we found a [[campaign/monsters/Tamarach\|Tamarach]], seemingly controlled by the Bloodfang leader through a strange **amulet**. The leader recognized Grolgrath and tried to use the Tamarach against us. We kept the amulet, which appeared to resemble a **Baphomet symbol**, and destroyed the connection.

This encounter took place while we were en route to [[campaign/locations/cities & islands/Gorvathcha\|Gorvathcha]], where we planned to meet with the [[campaign/factions/Dark Daggers\|Dark Daggers]], who had told us to find [[campaign/npcs/Miezul\|Miezul]], an ally who could help us gain entry into the city.

### **The Wolves**

As we approached Gorvakutha, we encountered a pack of **lycanthropic wolf-like people** led by a man named [[campaign/npcs/Bol\|Bol]]. He and his pack were searching for a **talisman** that once gave Bol power over one of his former packmates.


a small gnome named **Ibliz**, cursed with lycanthropy. Bol offered us a deal: if we found Ibliz and returned the talisman to him, his pack would owe us a debt.

We accepted and continued toward the city of Gorvakutha, sneaking in by posing as **slavers and slaves**. The city itself felt oppressive — dark and industrial, its streets crawling with guards and overseers. It reminded us of a vast **prison yard** more than a settlement.

Inside, we made our way to **Rusthorn Inn**, where we finally met **Scallius** of the Dark Daggers, who had been expecting us.
