> In **Grud-Thrak’s Cradle**, the party aided **Merillian Cinderglass**, an emissary from **Weldalath**, in his attempt to forge trade with the orc chieftain **Ugmarn One-Tusk**. With Merillian’s men imprisoned and diplomacy faltering, the party worked to restore trust and agreed to locate a missing herbal shipment. Amidst this tension, they bonded with locals at the **Hollow Ember Tavern**, and **Alias** charmed **Tizra**, a half-orc bard, adding a rare note of warmth to an otherwise grim outpost.

## AI Summary
While traveling with their wagons toward **Gorvakutha**, the party was ambushed by orcs of the **Bloodfang Tribe**, the same clan from which **Grolgrath** had once been exiled. During the fierce battle, the orc leader attempted to use a **Tamarach** creature against the group through a **dark amulet** resembling the **symbol of Baphomet**. After defeating them and severing the connection, the party learned that the Bloodfang leader recognized Grolgrath, stirring old wounds of shame and exile. In private, Grolgrath confided his guilt, and the narrator reassured him of his place within their fellowship.

Continuing their journey, the group encountered a band of **lycanthropic wolf-men** led by **Bol**, who sought a stolen **talisman** once granting him power over a rogue packmate — a cursed gnome named **Ibliz**. Bol offered them a pact: return the talisman, and his pack would owe them a debt. The party agreed and resumed their approach to **Gorvakutha**, infiltrating the foreboding city by posing as **slavers and captives**. Within its grim, industrial sprawl — more prison than settlement — they reached the **Rusthorn Inn**, where they finally met **Scallius** of the **Dark Daggers**, the contact who had been awaiting their arrival.

## Log
While traveling with our wagons, we were ambushed by a group of orcs — members of the [[campaign/factions/Bloodfang Tribe\|Bloodfang Tribe]], the same clan that [[campaign/npcs/Grolgath\|Grolgath]] once belonged to. After defeating them, I spoke privately with Grolgrath about why he left the clan and the shame he carried from it. I told him he would always have a place with us, no matter his past.

Among the orcs we found a [[campaign/monsters/Tamarach\|Tamarach]], seemingly controlled by the Bloodfang leader through a strange **amulet**. The leader recognized Grolgrath and tried to use the Tamarach against us. We kept the amulet, which appeared to resemble a **Baphomet symbol**, and destroyed the connection.

This encounter took place while we were en route to [[campaign/locations/4_cities_islands/Gorvathcha\|Gorvathcha]], where we planned to meet with the [[campaign/factions/Dark Daggers\|Dark Daggers]], who had told us to find [[campaign/npcs/Miezul\|Miezul]], an ally who could help us gain entry into the city.

### **The Wolves**

As we approached Gorvakutha, we encountered a pack of **lycanthropic wolf-like people** led by a man named [[campaign/npcs/Bol\|Bol]]. He and his pack were searching for a **talisman** that once gave Bol power over one of his former packmates.


a small gnome named **Ibliz**, cursed with lycanthropy. Bol offered us a deal: if we found Ibliz and returned the talisman to him, his pack would owe us a debt.

We accepted and continued toward the city of Gorvakutha, sneaking in by posing as **slavers and slaves**. The city itself felt oppressive — dark and industrial, its streets crawling with guards and overseers. It reminded us of a vast **prison yard** more than a settlement.

Inside, we made our way to **Rusthorn Inn**, where we finally met **Scallius** of the Dark Daggers, who had been expecting us.
