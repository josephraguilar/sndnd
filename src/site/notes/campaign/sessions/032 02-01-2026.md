## Session Summary
> [!tldr] [[campaign/sessions/032 02-01-2026\|032 02-01-2026]]
> The party presses deeper into the Uganathi stronghold, interrogating and executing a cedar witch before navigating a series of ritual chambers, storage halls, and brutal ambushes by goliaths, stone spawn, and cedar witches. They uncover a newly constructed blood-binding chamber tied to Uganathi and cedar witch cooperation, disrupt an active ritual, and loot a defiled lizardfolk throne room containing Grudrack’s hoarded wealth. After freeing prisoners and confirming Kaela was taken away with Grudrack, the party follows her trail out of the dungeon. The session ends with the group emerging onto an obsidian platform, face-to-face with Grudrack himself, flanked by warriors, stone spawn, and cedar witches, setting the stage for a major confrontation.

> The party explored a magma-scarred cavern and uncovered the remains of a rat dragon’s grisly hoard, recovering valuable currency, relics, and several powerful magic items. Guided by Vutha, they pushed deeper toward the Cradle of Smoke, narrowly avoiding disaster by cleverly pacifying and freeing a chained owlbear. Using the owlbear’s rampage as cover, the party stormed the training grounds and engaged Lazrack’s forces in a brutal battle against trainees and witches. Despite heavy spell pressure and multiple party members falling, the group prevailed through coordination and sheer force, ending the session with Obold restraining the final hag.

## AI Summary
### Interrogation & Loot

The party interrogates a captured cedar witch. She reveals that **Grudrack is always in his hideout** and is typically accompanied by **6–8 cedar witches** at all times. Thorin offers her freedom in exchange for useful information, but Obold deems her answers insufficient and executes her regardless, driven by his hatred of Iuz and the cedar witches.

The party loots the area, recovering:

- **3 Potions of Minor Healing**
    
- **2 Potions of Clairvoyance**
    
- **2 Vials of Poison**
    

They also recover a **Dimensional Net** — a large ranged weapon woven from the hair of celestials and fiends. The net grants **+1 to attack rolls** and prevents any **aberration, celestial, or fiend** restrained by it from escaping using alternate movement methods (teleportation, planar travel, etc.).

---

### The Chained Gorilla Encounter

After taking a **short rest** at the encampment, the party searches for another tunnel and approaches a sealed door. Obold listens and hears something **large and chained** inside. Gunther enters first and is immediately swiped at, though the attack misses. He attempts to army roll further inside, fails, and is brutally struck by a **large gorilla**.

What follows is a tense game of hide-and-seek and chicken as the party searches for an exit while avoiding the creature. Vutha uses **Pass Without Trace** to help locate an escape route. Meanwhile, Ophie disguises herself as a monkey, calms the gorilla by acting non-threatening, and feeds it **goodberries**, preventing further violence.

---

### Storage Chambers & Ambush

The party reaches the next chamber and takes a **long rest**. Continuing onward, Vutha opens another door leading to an old storage room that connects to a passage lined with **ancient lizardfolk skulls**. The tunnel is vaulted and reinforced, clearly lived in and maintained over many years. The passage splits left and right; the party chooses left.

Obold detects the scent of a living creature ahead. Vutha and Kaneko are sent forward to scout and discover **several goliaths waiting in the next room**. Ophie sneaks past them to block their escape, while Kormak uses **Misty Step** to do the same. Thorin casts **Silence**, and Vutha and Kaneko unleash a barrage of arrows. The party storms the room and quickly defeats the goliaths, with **Gunther taking the only significant damage**.

---

### The Blood Identification Chamber

Beyond the room lies another hallway leading to a staircase descending **30 feet**. Vutha and Kaneko again scout ahead and discover a **60-foot domed chamber** with slanted floors designed to funnel blood toward a **sunken circular carving of a closed eye** at the center.

Carved into the walls are depictions of the ancient **“tainted blood” gods**, including:

- Raven
    
- Wolf
    
- Bear
    
- Boar
    
- Lion
    
- Red Dragon
    
- Blue Dragon
    
- Black Dragon
    
- White Dragon
    

Alias approaches the **Blue Dragon** carving, where a **glowing copper rod** is embedded. He reaches out to touch it.

The party concludes this chamber is used to **identify bloodlines and bind individuals with collars**, believing it to be a **recent construction** created jointly by the **Uganathi clan and the cedar witches** to facilitate their rituals.

---

### Scouting the Depths

Kaneko and Vutha are sent down a heavily trafficked route, while Kormak sends his bird familiar down the opposite corridor. Kaneko and Vutha discover a barracks-like chamber containing **four stone spawn**.

The bird familiar travels down an extremely long hallway and discovers:

- A massive open cavern
    
- A giant iron door
    
- A smaller caged chamber
    

The party reunites and proceeds down the long hallway toward these locations.

---

### The Cedar Witch Ritual Chamber

Near the caged chamber, Obold detects **the scent of his mother**, though the party believes she is no longer there and is instead with Grudrack. Kormak sends his bird into the large cavern, revealing:

- **Three cedar witches**
    
    - One stirring a cauldron at the center
        
    - One kneeling at a ritual dais
        
    - One standing motionless with her head tilted unnaturally
        

The bird is spotted, but not before noticing an **alchemical workstation filled with potions**. Realizing they’ve been detected, the party charges in.

As combat begins:

- One cedar witch casts **Slow**, catching the entire party
    
- Another casts **Fireball**, hitting everyone
    

Vutha steps forward and lands a precise arrow, breaking the **Slow** caster’s concentration. Gunther charges in, **rages**, and begins glowing with **blinding wild magic energy**. Kaneko positions himself and unleashes a devastating volley, killing one witch. Ophie charges in wild-shaped as a bear, roaring intimidatingly. Lois fires **Eldritch Blast**, and Thorin casts **Hold Person** on the remaining witches. The party swiftly finishes them off.

---

### The Lizardfolk Throne Room

Returning to the **giant iron gate**, Gunther and Obold kick it open, revealing a massive cathedral-like chamber that clearly predates the Uganathi. It was once a **lizardfolk throne room**.

At the center stands an enormous throne, capped with carved skulls and rising high with jagged **obsidian spikes**. Two stone spawn stand guard at the base of the dais, each wielding heavy weapons. The hall is laid out with brutal symmetry; ancient lizardfolk markings have been defaced, and the polished floor shows signs of heavy use.

The stone spawn remain passive. Obold speaks the infernal phrase **“Kraga Opinn,”** unlocking their collars. Relieved, the stone spawn explain that **Grudrack’s treasure is hidden behind the throne** and leave peacefully.

The party loots:

- **4 chests of silver** (2,000 gp total)
    
- **2 chests of gold** (3,000 gp total)
    
- **Sapphires and rubies** (3,000 gp total)
    
- **A chest of obsidian trade coins** (claimed by Vutha)
    
- **Ceremonial weapons**:
    
    - 10 daggers (150 gp each)
        
    - 3 swords (250 gp each)
        
    - 5 spears (120 gp each)
        
- A rack of **old banners and standards** from defeated enemies

### Prisoners & Final Revelation

Gunther investigates the caged chamber and finds a frightened woman hiding inside. Obold frees her and asks about **Kaela**, but learns she left **about an hour earlier with Grudrack**. Ophie and Obold track Kaela’s scent deeper into the dungeon.

Following the trail, the party eventually loops back to the **initial hallway** scouted earlier by Vutha and Kaneko.

They enter a room filled with **broken and battered weapons** on racks. Two sealed doors stand opposite them; the bar meant to keep something contained has been removed. Gunther and Obold kick the doors open.

Cold gray light floods in from outside. A dense fog or heavy cloud blankets the area. The party steps onto an **obsidian platform**, where they see a semicircle of enemies waiting:

- **2 Uganathi warriors**
    
- **7 stone spawn**
    
- **2 cedar witches**
    

At the center stands **Grudrack — Obold’s father**.

## Log
The party interrogates the cedar witch, but she only tells us that Grudrack is always in his hideout. She says that he always has 6-8 cedar witches around him. THorin said she could leave if she provided us with anything useful, but Obold executed her anyways because he felt her information wasnt useful, and he hates Iuz and all his witch bitches. 

The party loots 3 potions of minor healing, 2 potions of clairvoyance, and two vials of poison. 

The party loots a large net, and its a dimensional net. woven from the hair of celestials and fiends, it can subdue otherworldly creatures. +1 to attack roll. prevents any aberration, celestial, or fiend, to leave through a different method of movement. Range weapon. 

The party takes a short rest at the encampment before trying to find the next tunnel. we approach another door, and obold peers in and hears something large and chained. Gunther goes in and gets swiped at, but it missed. He then tries to army roll in by fails and gets molly-wopped by a large gorilla. They party then begins to play a game of hide & seek and chicken with the gorilla looking for an exit. Vutha, using pass without trace, helps us find an exit, while Ophie pretends to be a Monkey and convinces the Gorilla that she is not aggressive, feeding it goodberries. 

The party makes it into the next room, and takes a long rest. We eventually find another door that Vutha opens, leading us to an old room, thats  store room of sorts. It leads to a passageway lined with old Lizardfolk skulls, and is vaulted as if it had been reinforced through the years and lived in. we came to a passageway that splits left and right. we go left, and make our way to another room ahead, obold smells something living up ahead. The party sends Vutha and Kaneko ahead to sneak and look at what awaits us. 

they find a couple goliaths waiting in a room. ophie sneaks past them to blocke their exit and so does kormak with a misty step. thorin drops silence on the room, while kaneko and vutha unleash a maelstrom of arrows. the party storms the room and quickly dispatch the goliaths, with only gunther taking significant damage.


the party then proceeds to a next hallwa, leading to a staircase going 30 ft down. kaneko and vutha proceed again sneaklily, and inspect the room. in the room is slanted floors that look to lead blood to a center circular etching sunken into the floor of a closed eye. on the walls of the 60' domed room, each representing one of the ancient gods of those with "tainted blood" gods. 

a raven, wolf, bear, boar , lion, red dragon, blue dragon, black dragon, white dragon.

Alias approaches the blue dragon one. it has a copper rod thats glowing with power. alias goes to touch the rod. 

the party feels that this is the area where the followers idnetify the blood line of people, and where they bind people with collars. We believe that this was a newly created area by the uganathi clan and the cedar witches in order to facilitate the binding. 

we send kaneko and vutha down a more trafficked route, and kormak sends his bird that he could see through its eyes down the other hallway. kaneko and vutha seems to walk into another barracks type room, and see four stone spawn in there. 

the bird goes down an extremely long hallway, and finds an open hallway-cavern, a giant iron door, and a caged door. The party goes down the long hallway to all the doors. We come upon the doors and the cavern hallway. 

obold smells traces of his mother in the caged room, but the party thinks she is not in there and is instead with Grudrack. The party sends kormaks bird to invest the large cavern. It sees an even larger cavern, and three cedar witches inside. one stands at a cauldron in the center of the room, another kneels at a ritual deis, and the third is unmoving, head tilted to the side.

The bird is seen, and as it is seen, it sees an alchemical station, with many potions. The party, realizing that they were spotted, charge the room. As they approach, a cedar witch casts slow, catching everyone, and another casts a fireball, catching everyone in the blast. 

Vutha steps forwards and lands a decisive arrow on the cedar witch that casts slow, dropping their concentration, allowing the part to rally. Gunther runs forward, rages, and with his wild magic begins glowing with a blinding light. Kaneko goes into a corner into the room, and lays down a flurry of arrows, destroying a cedar witch. Ophie runs in as a bear and lets out an intimidating roar. Lois walks up and shoots one with an eldritch blast. Thorin walks up and uses hold person on the remaining two cedar witches and the party quickly dispatches them. 

we go back to the large iron gate, gunther and obold kick it open. It opens up into a large cathedral that was not of uganathi. it was an old throne room for the lizardfolk. 

There is a giant oversized chair in the center, capped with carved skulls, the back rising high with jagged obsidian spikes. 

There are two stone spawns standing watch at the base of the deis, each holding a heavy weapon. They see the party. The hall is arranged with brutal symmetry, lizardfolk markings now defaced by the uganathi. floor polished smooth form heavy foot traffic. 

the two stone spawn stay watching the door. Obold says the infernal words "Kraga Opinn", unlocking the collars of the stonespawn. Obold asks them if there is anything of value in the room. they say that there is Grudrack's treasure behind the throne.  They are relieved and happy to leave peacefully. we carefully walk around eachother and the party loots the treasure. 

4 chests full of silver, worth 2000 gold total

2 chests full of gold, valued at 3000Gold total

chests of sapphire and rubies, valued at 3000 gold

a chest of obsidian trade coins that vutha wants

ceremonial trophy weapons, 10 ceremonial daggers 150 g each, 3 ceremonial swords 250g each, 5 ceremonial spears, 120gp each.

rack holding old banners and standards from defeated enemies. 

Gunther go back to the caged room and see woman cowering in fear from the noise. Obold releases the woman and looks for Kaela, they do not have her there but say she left an hour ago with Grudrack. Ophie and Obold begin tracking her scent which leads down further into the Dungeon. we follow the tracks and eventually loop and find ourselves in the first initial hallway that vutha and Kaneko scouted earlier. 

We find a room with lots of battered an broken weapons on a weapons rack, and two doors that are shut and should have a bar blocking something from getting out into our side, but the bar is gone. Gunther and Obold kick in the door, and we see light from the outside shine on us. It is very gray outside, as if there is a fog or heavy cloud in our area. We walk out onto an obsidian style platform. we see standing in a semi-circle, two Uganathi warraiors, 7 stone spawn, 2 cedar witches, and in the center is Obolds Father, Grudrack.
