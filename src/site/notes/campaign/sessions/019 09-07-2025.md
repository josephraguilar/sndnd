## Log
We met with **Scallius** in Gorvakutha to discuss plans for freeing **Viola**. Scallius left to retrieve **Artalka**, an agent of the **Harpers** who could help us. She specializes in breaking curses, and together we devised a plan to infiltrate **Chainspire Tower**, where **Ruza** and **Zaryrok** were holding Viola captive.

After fighting our way through the tower, we defeated the necromancer **Ruza**, slaying him and freeing both Viola and Zaryrok. We escaped through a network of mine tunnels beneath the city, emerging into the hills outside Gorvakutha. That night, as we camped under the stars, we each experienced strange and vivid dreams.
### **After the Battle**

In the aftermath, **Viola** and **Thorin** left the group. Viola said she intended to return to Arkalka and help continue the slave revolt. During this time, we learned that **Rashmak Skullhunter**, the orc who killed Thorin’s wife and son, was last seen near **Craghawk’s Respite**.

Arkalka remained behind to gather more information on the Harpers, while Scallius handed **Grunkthor** a sealed note, saying that he would be in touch — and that we still owed him a debt.

**Grograh** departed to challenge his old Bloodfang leader and claim his place as the new chieftain.

### **The Journey Ahead**

We began discussing how to return to our ship. The group decided to travel along the coast to reach **Craghawk’s Respite**. Along the way, we learned that **Gwalduhr Towers** are the source of the **Three Sea Hags’ power**.

While resting, we encountered **Grunka**, who mentioned a port called **Callum’s Port in Callumsham** — our next destination.
