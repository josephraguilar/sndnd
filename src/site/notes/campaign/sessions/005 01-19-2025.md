> The party set sail toward Waterdeep, learning Kalista is engaged to the Betrayer King—now an ally against _The Three_. Choosing to rescue Thorin’s daughter over avenging Obold’s mother, they fought off an undead ship where Thorin was possessed. Soon after, a monstrous Aboleth struck their vessel, forcing them to crash-land on the island of Mintarin.

## AI Summary
After making landfall on Mintarin to repair their damaged ship, the party gathered supplies but discovered Holda had gone missing. Tracking her into a cave, they solved a riddle that opened a hidden passage leading to an ancient temple dedicated to Baphomet. Inside, they found Holda standing beside an avatar of the demon lord, revealing her heritage as one of Baphomet’s children—just like Louis. Confronted by Baphomet himself and his four-armed minotaur guardian, the group was forced to choose between pledging allegiance or fighting for their lives. With his faith in Luz gone, Obold accepted Baphomet’s offer, trading the _Book of Iuz_ for the magical halberd _Z’Daria Nix_ and vowing to use his power against slavers. Each party member was shown a personal vision—Alias saw Xanaphia’s uncertain fate, Ophie a crown of flowers, Thorin his living daughter, Gunther a fawn, and Obold a Goliath who may have been his father.  
After leaving the temple, the crew returned to their repaired ship and safely reached Waterdeep. There, Alias confirmed that the _Queen’s Bitch_ still roams the seas, and the group sold their cargo before meeting with Irlan, who introduced them to Melian, the Queen of Niavara.

## Log
After landing on the island of [[campaign/locations/4_cities_islands/Mintarin\|Mintarin]], the party sets off to collect wood to repair the ship.  We were able to quickly gather enough wood, but [[campaign/players/Thorin\|Thorin]] noticed that [[campaign/npcs/Holda\|Holda]] had wandered off. 

Fearing she had been abducted, the party went off looking for her. We followed her trail and it led us to a cave. After solving a riddle on one of the cave walls, we opened a passage that led further into the cave. 

There was a large hole in the ground that we could sense an evil presence in. We tried to speak to the beast within and feed it, but it led nowhere. 

Eventually we entered what appeared to be a place of worship and killed a couple minotaurs. In the next room was the primary chamber and within it was Holda, with an Avatar of Baphomet next to her. We learned that she is a child of [[campaign/npcs/Baphomet\|Baphomet]] just like [[campaign/players/Lois\|Lois]]. 

We realized we had barged into a temple of Baphomet, and he was not happy about it. Behind us, a large four armed minotaur monstrosity appeared. We were cornered and Baphomet wanted one of us to pledge our souls to him, or we would have to fight our way out. This was at odds with Louis, who did not want us to fight. 

[[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]], not having a God to give him powers anymore, decided he would agree to follow baphomet, as he took no issue with taking lives, so long as they were of slavers. He also takes no issue with gathering followers for a God such as him. 

Baphomet bartered with the party for information and power. 
- Obold gave Baphomet the [[campaign/items/Book of Iuz\|Book of Iuz]] in exchange for a a magical halberd called [[campaign/npcs/Z'Daria Nix\|Z'Daria Nix]]. 
- [[campaign/players/Alias\|Alias]] learns that [[campaign/npcs/Xanaphia\|Xanaphia]] is no longer on the [[campaign/items/Queens Bitch\|Queens Bitch]], though Alias cant be certain if baphomet is lying or not.
- [[campaign/players/Ophie\|Ophie]] is shown herself with a flowery crown
- Thorin is shown his daughter alive
- [[campaign/players/Gunther\|Gunther]] is shown a fawn
- Obold is shown an image of a Goliath (his father maybe?)

The party leaves the cave and heads back to the ship which has been repaired. We then set off to Waterdeep and make it unscathed. 

Once we arrive in waterdeep Alias asks around about the Queen's Bitch at some bars. He learns that the ship is still afloat and terrorizing the seas as always. 

The party sells some goods it's been holding onto. Afterwards we meet with Irlan at a bar, and he is speaking with a woman. We are then introduced to [[campaign/npcs/Melian\|Melian]], the queen of [[campaign/npcs/Niavara\|Niavara]].
