## Log
The commotion woke everyone. [[campaign/npcs/Grusksa\|Grusksa]], the half-orc woman who owned the farmhouse, rushed out and used an **amulet** to calm the creature, forcing it back into the earth. The undead guardian sank beneath the soil, and peace returned to the graveyard.

At dawn, we resumed our travels with Tibit now accompanying us. we learn of a trading city named [[campaign/locations/sites/Grud-Thacks Cradle\|Grud-Thacks Cradle]], where travelers were charged **5 gold pieces** to enter.

### **The Slave Caravan**

on the way to [[campaign/locations/sites/Grud-Thacks Cradle\|Grud-Thacks Cradle]], we came across a **caravan of orcs** bearing the banners of the [[campaign/factions/Veruz Rexna\|Veruz Rexna]], accompanied by a Cedar Witch and a group of **chained slaves**.

After a tense and bloody battle, we freed the captives and captured one of the surviving Paladins of Iuz for questioning. During the interrogation, we learned the following:

- The caravan had come from [[campaign/locations/cities & islands/Caer Callidier\|Caer Callidier]] to meet with someone connected to the **Order of Iuz**.
    
- The slaves were being **transported to the mines**.
    
- They were **marked by [[campaign/factions/The Three\|The Three]]
    
- Their Witch’s name was [[campaign/npcs/Kragatha\|Kragatha]].
- They had met with [[campaign/factions/The Three\|The Three]] prior to leaving
    
- The slaves were mostly **dwarves of different clans and origins**, along with several **gnomes**.

The paladins name was [[campaign/npcs/Svayne\|Svayne]], and the one who was slain was named [[campaign/npcs/Magnus\|Magnus]]

The party used speak with dead to ask Kragatha questions
- who were you meeting?
	- [[campaign/npcs/Maghla Blackfang\|Maghla Blackfang]]
- Why were you meeting with them?
	- They were sent to talk about protecting the [[campaign/locations/sites/Galdur Tower\|Galdur Tower]]
- Which member of the three sent them.
	- [[campaign/npcs/Rotten Agnis Worm Wiggle\|Rotten Agnis Worm Wiggle]]
- Where is Galdur tower?
	- in [[campaign/locations/regions & archipalegos/Calimshan\|Calimshan]]

While the party is trying to decide what to do with the remaining paladin Svayne, Obold forces him to pledge his soul to Baphomet, then executes him in cold blood.
