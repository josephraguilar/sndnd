> After slaying **Vrax Sithra**, a dwarven experiment turned spider Matriarch, the party journeyed south into a deadly **Ash Storm** and found refuge in a **farmhouse** run by orcish gravekeepers. Among them was **Tibit**, a curious gnome tinkerer whose greed led him to desecrate the nearby graveyard. His actions awakened a **giant undead guardian**, forcing the heroes into yet another grim confrontation amid ash and death.

## AI Summary
The chaos from Tibit’s graveyard blunder ended when **Grusksa**, the half-orc gravekeeper, emerged and used a **magical amulet** to pacify the undead guardian, commanding it back beneath the earth. Peace returned to the graveyard by dawn, and the party continued their journey south with **Tibit** now traveling alongside them. Along the road, they learned of a fortified trading hub called **Grud-Thack’s Cradle**, known for taxing all travelers who entered.

While en route, the party encountered a **slave caravan** escorted by orcs under the banner of the **Veruz Rexna**, accompanied by a **Cedar Witch** and **Paladins of Iuz**. After a fierce battle, the group slew the witch and her guards, freed the slaves, and captured one surviving paladin named **Svayne**. Interrogation revealed that the caravan had come from **Caer Callidier** and was headed to the **mines**, delivering dwarven and gnomish slaves marked by **The Three**. The witch, **Kragatha**, had been meeting with **Maghla Blackfang** under orders from **Rotten Agnis Worm Wiggle**, one of The Three, to discuss the defense of **Galdur Tower** — a stronghold located in **Calimshan**.

To extract further answers, the party used **Speak with Dead** on Kragatha’s corpse. After learning the truth, **Obold** took matters into his own hands — forcing Svayne to **pledge his soul to Baphomet** before executing him without mercy, a chilling act that left the rest of the group uneasy as they pressed on toward Grud-Thack’s Cradle.

## Log
The commotion woke everyone. [[campaign/npcs/Grusksa\|Grusksa]], the half-orc woman who owned the farmhouse, rushed out and used an **amulet** to calm the creature, forcing it back into the earth. The undead guardian sank beneath the soil, and peace returned to the graveyard.

At dawn, we resumed our travels with Tibit now accompanying us. we learn of a trading city named [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Grud-Thacks Cradle\|Grud-Thacks Cradle]], where travelers were charged **5 gold pieces** to enter.

### **The Slave Caravan**

on the way to [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Grud-Thacks Cradle\|Grud-Thacks Cradle]], we came across a **caravan of orcs** bearing the banners of the [[campaign/factions/Veruz Rexna\|Veruz Rexna]], accompanied by a Cedar Witch and a group of **chained slaves**.

After a tense and bloody battle, we freed the captives and captured one of the surviving Paladins of Iuz for questioning. During the interrogation, we learned the following:

- The caravan had come from [[campaign/locations/4_cities_islands/Caer Callidier\|Caer Callidier]] to meet with someone connected to the **Order of Iuz**.
    
- The slaves were being **transported to the mines**.
    
- They were **marked by [[campaign/factions/The Three\|The Three]]
    
- Their Witch’s name was [[campaign/npcs/Kragatha\|Kragatha]].
- They had met with [[campaign/factions/The Three\|The Three]] prior to leaving
    
- The slaves were mostly **dwarves of different clans and origins**, along with several **gnomes**.

The paladins name was [[campaign/npcs/Svayne\|Svayne]], and the one who was slain was named [[campaign/npcs/Magnus\|Magnus]]

The party used speak with dead to ask Kragatha questions
- who were you meeting?
	- [[campaign/npcs/Maghla Blackfang\|Maghla Blackfang]]
- Why were you meeting with them?
	- They were sent to talk about protecting the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Galdur Towers\|Galdur Towers]]
- Which member of the three sent them.
	- [[campaign/npcs/Rotten Agnis Worm Wiggle\|Rotten Agnis Worm Wiggle]]
- Where is Galdur tower?
	- in [[campaign/locations/2_regions & archipelagos/Calimshan\|Calimshan]]

While the party is trying to decide what to do with the remaining paladin Svayne, Obold forces him to pledge his soul to Baphomet, then executes him in cold blood.
