## Log
While searching [[campaign/npcs/Zorath the Veilbinder\|Zorath the Veilbinder]]'s tower, Thorin discovered [[campaign/items/Embris's Letter\|Embris's Letter]]. Iw was written in druidic and only [[campaign/players/Ophie\|Ophie]] could read it. it was addressed to zorath and was asking him to unite [[The Four\|The Four]]. He seemed to be a member of "The Four" . The seem interested in finding the final piece to a map to "the promise land", which we suspect to be [[campaign/locations/3_nations/Lebor Gabala\|Lebor Gabala]] after Ophie informs the party a bit about her past. Zorath was being summoned to a meeting place with the four at the [[Crossroads of the Four Pillars\|Crossroads of the Four Pillars]] during the next full moon. Kaneko is able to grab a piece of paper that looks like a map before the tower started to collapse. The party escaped the collapsing tower and rested. 

As the party is trying to rest they are attacked by some form of goblins. The party pushes forward the next day and Ophie fools some of Zorath's creatures into letting us pass peacefully. 

A dark tiefling and female half orc from the dark daggers approach us and ask us if we have zorath's gems. They escort us to the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Velvet Veil\|Velvet Veil]] . There was a pirate there named [[Corvin\|Corvin]] that [[campaign/players/Alias\|Alias]] does not recognize but they exchanged nods. 

[[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] learns that the [[campaign/factions/Dark Daggers\|Dark Daggers]] were the ones who put the party on the slave ship the [[campaign/items/Bitch's Scorn\|Bitch's Scorn]] in the first place and was angered that the dark daggers actively enabled slave trade. He held his tongue just long enough for the party to get their boat and leave. 

The party then finally took off for [[campaign/locations/2_regions & archipelagos/Velen\|Velen]]. They encountered some [[campaign/factions/Shag Dominica\|Shag Dominica]] that were attacked a merchant ship and defended the merchants. Obold convinced many of the crew to follow [[campaign/npcs/Baphomet\|Baphomet]] after we had saved their lives. 

The party also passes some orc pirates peacefully. They mention to the party the location of [[campaign/locations/4_cities_islands/Kragthars Respite\|Kragthars Respite]], which Alias remembers to be a pirate port in Velen.
