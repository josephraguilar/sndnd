## AI Summary
While exploring **Zorath the Veilbinder’s** collapsing tower, **Thorin** discovered **Embris’s Letter**, written in druidic and readable only by **Ophie**. The letter, addressed to Zorath, urged him to unite **The Four**, a mysterious group seeking the final piece of a map to _“the promised land,”_ believed to be **Lebor Gabala**. The message also revealed a planned meeting at the **Crossroads of the Four Pillars** during the next full moon. Before the tower fell, **Kaneko** managed to grab a fragment of the map. After escaping, the party was ambushed by goblins while resting, but survived and continued their journey, with Ophie cleverly deceiving some of Zorath’s creatures to avoid further conflict.

Soon after, a **dark tiefling** and **half-orc emissary** from the **Dark Daggers** confronted the party, demanding Zorath’s gems. They escorted the group back to the **Velvet Veil**, where a pirate named **Corvin** silently acknowledged **Alias**. During the meeting, **Obold** learned that the Dark Daggers were responsible for the party’s initial enslavement aboard the **Bitch’s Scorn** and struggled to contain his rage, keeping quiet until they recovered their ship and set sail.

En route to **Velen**, the party defended a merchant vessel from **Shag Dominica** sea beasts, earning the crew’s loyalty — many of whom **Obold** persuaded to follow **Baphomet**. They also encountered a group of **orc pirates**, who peacefully shared the location of **Kragthar’s Respite**, a notorious pirate haven near Velen known to Alias.

## Log
While searching [[campaign/npcs/Zorath the Veilbinder\|Zorath the Veilbinder]]'s tower, Thorin discovered [[campaign/items/Embris's Letter\|Embris's Letter]]. Iw was written in druidic and only [[campaign/players/Ophie\|Ophie]] could read it. it was addressed to zorath and was asking him to unite [[The Four\|The Four]]. He seemed to be a member of "The Four" . The seem interested in finding the final piece to a map to "the promise land", which we suspect to be [[campaign/locations/3_nations/Lebor Gabala\|Lebor Gabala]] after Ophie informs the party a bit about her past. Zorath was being summoned to a meeting place with the four at the [[Crossroads of the Four Pillars\|Crossroads of the Four Pillars]] during the next full moon. Kaneko is able to grab a piece of paper that looks like a map before the tower started to collapse. The party escaped the collapsing tower and rested. 

As the party is trying to rest they are attacked by some form of goblins. The party pushes forward the next day and Ophie fools some of Zorath's creatures into letting us pass peacefully. 

A dark tiefling and female half orc from the dark daggers approach us and ask us if we have zorath's gems. They escort us to the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Velvet Veil\|Velvet Veil]] . There was a pirate there named [[campaign/npcs/Corvin\|Corvin]] that [[campaign/players/Alias\|Alias]] does not recognize but they exchanged nods. 

[[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] learns that the [[campaign/factions/Dark Daggers\|Dark Daggers]] were the ones who put the party on the slave ship the [[campaign/items/Bitch's Scorn\|Bitch's Scorn]] in the first place and was angered that the dark daggers actively enabled slave trade. He held his tongue just long enough for the party to get their boat and leave. 

The party then finally took off for [[campaign/locations/2_regions & archipelagos/Velen\|Velen]]. They encountered some [[campaign/factions/Shag Dominica\|Shag Dominica]] that were attacked a merchant ship and defended the merchants. Obold convinced many of the crew to follow [[campaign/npcs/Baphomet\|Baphomet]] after we had saved their lives. 

The party also passes some orc pirates peacefully. They mention to the party the location of [[campaign/locations/4_cities_islands/Kragthars Respite\|Kragthars Respite]], which Alias remembers to be a pirate port in Velen.
