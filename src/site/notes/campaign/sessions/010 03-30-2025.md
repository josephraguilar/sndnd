After escaping the collapsing tower, they were captured by **Dark Daggers**, returned to the **Velvet Veil**, and reclaimed their ship — learning the guild had enslaved them aboard the _Bitch’s Scorn_. Sailing toward **Velen**, they defended merchants from sea monsters and won new converts to **Baphomet**, while discovering the pirate port **Kragthar’s Respite**.

## AI Summary
While sailing toward **Velen**, the party encountered multiple **Ironclad Enclave** ships and cleverly hoisted an Enclave flag to pass safely. After surviving a violent storm, they reached the **peninsula of Velen**, where a bustling harbor awaited them — filled with ships bearing familiar, foreign, and unmarked flags. The group entered **The Kraken’s Cup**, a tavern built into a hollowed-out ship, and quickly realized that they were in a hub for the **slave trade**. This grim revelation connected to **Hilda’s past**, as this was the port where she was first brought before being sent to the mines.

Inside the tavern, a half-orc bartender explained that Velen was divided among **four orc tribes**:

- The **Black Maw Tribe** — rulers of **Kragthar’s Respite** and the **slave mines**, wealthy and ruthless.
    
- The **Bonerend Tribe** — former slaves turned outcasts, marked by broken skull emblems.
    
- The **Ash Vulture Tribe** — opportunistic mercenaries bearing the vulture symbol.
    
- The **Bloodfang Tribe** — violent zealots symbolized by a bleeding red eye.
    

The party traveled three days south toward **Kragthar’s Respite**, crossing savannah terrain and meeting **Grolgath**, an exiled orc of the Bloodfang tribe hiding beneath a bridge. He revealed that his tribe had once controlled the mines and described the brutal atrocities that led to his exile. After healing him, Grolgath guided the party west through the **ogre wastelands**, where they fought **rhinos** and discovered traces of **ritual flowers** used in worship of the orc god **Gruumsh**, hinting at darker powers at work in the region.

## Log
In route to Velen the party encounters an [[campaign/factions/Ironclad Enclave\|Ironclad Enclave]] ship. It is being escorted by two other ships so the party decides to raise its Ironclad Enclave flag and pass by peacefully. This happens once more before the party passes through a massive storm. They make it through safely before finally making it to the peninsula of Velen. 

As the party ports, they see a multitude of ships. Some with flags they recognize, some with flags they dont, and some with no flags at all. The party heads to a tavern framed out of a hollowed out ship with a building attached that is called the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Krakens Cup\|Krakens Cup]]. The party realizes it is very clear that they are in a slaving area. This apparantly is where [[Hilda\|Hilda]] was first brought to before being taken to the mines, which is a few days travel away. It is a very diverse location. 

In the Krakens cup a half orc female bartender is able to tell us that [[campaign/locations/2_regions & archipelagos/Velen\|Velen]] is seperated into 4 orc clans. [[campaign/locations/4_cities_islands/Kragthars Respite\|Kragthars Respite]] is ran by the [[campaign/factions/Black Maw Tribe\|Black Maw Tribe]]. There is also the [[campaign/factions/Bonerend Tribe\|Bonerend Tribe]], the [[campaign/factions/Ash Vulture Tribe\|Ash Vulture Tribe]], and the [[campaign/factions/Bloodfang Tribe\|Bloodfang Tribe]]. 

The Black Maw run the slave mines and are the wealthiest tribe currently. They are brutal enforces of the slave trade, raid alot, and work with underworld syndicates. 

The Bonerend Tribe were once slaves but broke out into outcasts. They have chests and belts with broken skulls. 

The Ash Vulture tribe carry a vulture symbol, and are mercenary opportunists. 

The bloodfang tribe have a red eye sumbol that drips blood and are crazy.

After learning this the party travels for 3 days to the south of Velen, headed towards [[campaign/locations/4_cities_islands/Kragthars Respite\|Kragthars Respite]]. As they head further south & inland the terrain becomes more savannah like. On the road the party crosses a bridge withh an orc hiding underneath it. We learn that he is an exil of the bloodfang clan. His name is [[campaign/npcs/Grolgath\|Grolgath]]. He traveled from the river to the east. His party was raiding and committing atrocities, killing even women and children. When he objected he was attacked by his own clan and left for dead. He informs us that at one time the bloodfang clan was in control of the mine, and that it is the center of a lot of currrent conflicts in the area. 

Grolgath suggests getting off the road and takes the party west after they healed him. He helps the party travel through the ogre wastelands and face some rhinos. After the fight Grolgath mentions he noticed the smell of ritual flowers which are used in the worship of the Orc god [[campaign/npcs/Gruumsh\|Gruumsh]].
