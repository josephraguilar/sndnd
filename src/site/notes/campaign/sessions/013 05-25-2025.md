## Log
As we descend into the dwarven mine, we move cautiously, avoiding falling shoulders of rock while walking down narrow halls. The dwarves among us discover a broken pedestal once holding a bar of **mithril**. Many of the mine’s chambers are littered with the corpses of both dwarves and orcs alike. Among the wreckage, we find a locked chest, which we manage to open. Inside are several mithril shards, a vial of gray liquid, and a few documents written in Dwarvish.

The battle here appears to have taken place roughly **30 to 40 years ago**. Deeper in, we come upon a large open chamber that was once part of the main mining operation. In its center stands a **fresh pyramid-shaped mound**. As [[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] moves toward it, a swarm of **ants** emerges. [[campaign/players/Ophie\|Ophie]] speaks with them, offering goodberries, and the creatures retreat peacefully.

Continuing north through the caverns, we see webs draped along the stalactites above. This area feels alive — glowing fungi provide a natural light that illuminates the passageways.

We carry a lantern lit by [[campaign/players/Kormak\|Kormak]], and further in, we discover an ancient dwarven warning carved into the wall:

> “Beware what shimmers in the dark.”

Moments later, massive **blue giant spiders** phase in and attack. A fierce battle follows in this web-filled chamber, but we defeat the spiders and continue deeper into the mine.

The next cavern contains four **crystals**, one at each corner. A faint hum of energy fills the air. Kormak climbs up to retrieve the crystals — he manages to grab two before vanishing into some kind of **limbo-like void**. After a moment, he reappears, shaken but alive.

We continue onward into another cavern filled with more **phase spiders** and glowing fungal growths. We collect several **mithril nuggets** and fragments before pressing on.

Further down, we reach the heart of the mine. Its scale dwarfs the rest of the tunnels. The walls are blanketed in webbing, and large **egg sacs** hang suspended from the ceiling. We begin to hear a telepathic voice in our minds — that of [[campaign/npcs/Vrax Sithra\|Vrax Sithra]], the **Matriarch** of the giant spiders.
