## AI Summary
After meeting Queen Melian of Niavara and learning she had earned her impressive armor by slaying a dragon, the party spent the night in Waterdeep before preparing to continue their journey. The next day, they went shopping and reaffirmed that Alias would serve as captain of _The Bitch’s Scorn_—a role even Obold agreed was well deserved. The crew set sail toward Velen, stopping briefly in Baldur’s Gate for supplies. During the stop, Obold set out an alms box to gather followers for Baphomet, and Louis followed some converts to complete their initiation into worship. In gratitude, she received a blessed amulet, to Obold’s quiet envy. With supplies restocked and their faiths renewed, the party once again took to the seas, determined to reach Velen without further delay.

## Log
The party speaks with [[campaign/npcs/Melian\|Melian]] and ask where she got her cool armor from. She said that she got it from slaying a dragon. She leaves and the party rests for a night.

The next day we go shopping and then set sail. The party (especially [[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]]) determine that [[campaign/players/Alias\|Alias]] is considered the captain of the ship. (obvious choice, honestly). 

We set sail for [[campaign/locations/Velen\|Velen]] and stop at [[campaign/locations/Baldurs Gate\|Baldurs Gate]] on the way for supplies. Obold sets out his alms box and gets a couple people to pay alms to [[campaign/npcs/Baphomet\|Baphomet]]. [[campaign/players/Louis\|Louis]] follows some of them and takes them to a place of worship to fully convert them. After doing so she receives an amulet in a show of appreciation for her service (Obold is jealous). 

The party then sets sail one last time for Velen and nothing is going to stop them now!
