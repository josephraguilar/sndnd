## AI Summary
As they party was trying to escape, they were ambushed by Arch bishop Corin Mag, whom they ultimately defeated. Afterward, they discovered that Salyx, Thexus, and Zae are family, with Salyx and Zae being lovers. Thexus and Zae arrived after the battle to receive the _Galdrabrock_, while Kira appeared to claim her promised books. Outside the temple, chaos reigned as multiple factions — the Velvet Blade, the Gloomshadow, Slack’s goblins, and the paladins of Iuz — clashed. The party made a daring escape through the battlefield, using an invisible hijacked wagon and magic traps to flee, though a firebolt attack nearly killed Louis and Kaneko. They managed to reach the woods, leap from a cliff to their skiff, and sail back to their ship, _The Bitch’s Scorn_, where Irlan Liaric awaited them alongside the unexpected return of Kalista.

## Log
After the party found the [[campaign/items/Book of Iuz\|Book of Iuz]], the [[campaign/items/Book of Necromancy\|Book of Necromancy]], and the [[campaign/items/Book on 8th Level of Hell\|Book on 8th Level of Hell]] they tried to escape, but as we exited the underbelly of the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Temple of the high Cleric\|Temple of the high Cleric]], [[campaign/npcs/Arch Bishop Corin Mag\|Arch Bishop Corin Mag]] was waiting on us!

We got in yet another fight and were victorious, felling Corin Mag. 

The party learns that [[campaign/npcs/Salyx\|Salyx]], [[campaign/npcs/Thexus\|Thexus]], and [[campaign/npcs/Zae\|Zae]] are all related and Zae and Salyx are lovers. (I assume someone is an in-law)

thexus and zae walked in after we defeated [[campaign/npcs/Arch Bishop Corin Mag\|Arch Bishop Corin Mag]] and we gave them the [[campaign/items/Galdrabrock\|Galdrabrock]]

[[campaign/npcs/Kira\|Kira]] walked in after we defeated the Arch Bishop, and we gave her the Book of Necromancy and the Book on the 8th level of Hell as promised. 

As the party is trying to leave the temple there is a huge battle going on outside between the [[campaign/factions/Velvet Blade\|Velvet Blade]], the [[campaign/factions/Gloomshadow\|Gloomshadow]], [[campaign/npcs/Slack\|Slack]]'s goblins, and the paladins of Iuz. 

WE MUST ESCAPE!

[[campaign/players/Ophie\|Ophie]] goes invisible to hijack us a wagon. The party uses it to crash through the battle. We were chased by another wagon fill of Veruz Rexna, but we let out oil slick and magic thorns and the party made quick work of them. As they were going down, a witch that was with them threw a forebolt at us, catching the wagon on fire and knocking out [[campaign/players/Lois\|Lois]] and [[campaign/players/Kaneko\|Kaneko]]. The party was able to get out of the wagon and defend them long enough to become stable and we took off to the woods to escape. Unfortunately we were met with a cliffside, our getaway skiff sitting below.  We all decided to risk it and jump, thankfully we made it safely. We rowed back to the docks where [[campaign/npcs/Irlan Liaric\|Irlan Liaric]] was waiting for us on the [[campaign/items/Bitch's Scorn\|Bitch's Scorn]] with someone at his side. We soon realized that it was none other than [[campaign/npcs/Kalista\|Kalista]]!
