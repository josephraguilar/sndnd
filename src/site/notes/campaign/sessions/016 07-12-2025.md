> After Grusksa quelled the undead guardian, the party set out with **Tibit** and clashed with a **slave caravan** belonging to the **Veruz Rexna** and **Paladins of Iuz**. They liberated dwarven and gnomish slaves and learned of **The Three**, who plotted to defend **Galdur Tower** in **Calimshan**. When interrogation ended, **Obold** demanded the captured paladin swear himself to **Baphomet** before executing him, leaving a dark mark on the party’s journey.

## AI Summary
Following the bloody encounter on the road, the party arrived in the orcish trade stronghold of **Grud-Thrak’s Cradle**, a fortress carved into black stone cliffs amidst ash and dust. There, they met **Merillian Cinderglass**, a refined emissary from the **Forest Kingdom of Weldalath**, who hired the group as his protection during delicate trade negotiations. His mission: to convince **Ugmarn One-Tusk**, chieftain of the Cradle, to open trade routes between **Velen** and **Weldalath** for access to rare materials.

Merillian’s situation was dire. His previous escort had been imprisoned after refusing to partake in a local orcish ritual requiring them to drink **scorpion venom** to prove their worth. Seeking diplomacy and assistance, Merillian enlisted the party to strengthen his bargaining position and recover Ugmarn’s favor.

Upon meeting Ugmarn, the orc leader agreed to consider trade—on one condition: that Merillian and the party retrieve a **missing shipment of medicinal herbs** from Velen. During their stay in town, the group spent time at the **Hollow Ember Tavern**, befriending its orcish owner **Ketzrak**, and later visited the **Cindersink Bathhouse**, where **Alias** met the half-orc bathhouse keeper **Tizra**. After an impressive performance, Alias persuaded Tizra to perform as a bard for a night at the Hollow Ember, leaving a positive impression before the group prepared for their next venture.

## Log
After the events on the road, we traveled to [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Grud-Thacks Cradle\|Grud-Thacks Cradle]], where we met a merchant named [[campaign/npcs/Merillian Cinderglass\|Merillian Cinderglass]]. He hired us to act as his protection and muscle while he attempted to negotiate trade between [[campaign/locations/2_regions & archipelagos/Velen\|Velen]] and the **Forest Kingdom of [[campaign/locations/3_nations/Weldalath\|Weldalath]].

Before meeting him, we stopped to take care of a few errands — picking up supplies and visiting a local magic shop — before finally joining Marillian to begin the journey.

### **Merillian Cinderglass**

Merillian is a well-spoken emissary from the **Forest Kingdom of Weldalath**. He was sent by the king and queen to persuade [[campaign/npcs/Ugmarn One Tusk\|Ugmarn One Tusk]], leader of Grud Thrak Cradle, to open trade relations between their two nations. They require rare materials from Velen and the surrounding lands.

However, Merillian and his men had  been asked to drink **scorpion venom** as part of an orc tradition during trade talks. When they refused, his men were imprisoned leaving him desperate and short-handed. Merillian hoped that we could aid him in talks with Ugmarn and helping release his men, and strengthening Weldalath’s trade position.

- Ugmarn = Orc leader of **Grud Thrak Cradle**
    
- Marillian’s mission: secure diplomacy and mutual trade routes between **Velen** and **Weldalath**

### **Grud Thrak Cradle**

Upon arriving at Grud Thrak Cradle, we met Marillian outside its great hall. The orc settlement was a fortified trade post carved into black stone cliffs, surrounded by ash and dust.

Marillian introduced us to Ugmarn and explained his purpose. Ugmarn agreed to speak further — but only if Marillian helped him recover a missing shipment of medicinal herbs from Velen.

### **The Hollow Ember Tavern**

During our stay, we spent some time in town. We befriended th e owner of the local tavern, the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Hollow Ember\|Hollow Ember]], whose name was [[campaign/npcs/Ketzrak\|Ketzrak]].

Later, I visited the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Cindersink Bathhouse\|Cindersink Bathhouse]], where I met a half-orc, half-orc woman named [[campaign/npcs/Tizra\|Tizra]] who worked as the bathhouse keeper. After spending the day there, [[campaign/players/Alias\|Alias]] successfully talked her into becoming the tavern’s live-in bard for a night. My performance was apparently convincing enough that she promised to sing if he ever returned to Grud Thrak Cradle.
