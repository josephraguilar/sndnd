## AI Summary
As the party departed Baldur’s Gate, they were intercepted by the _Black Fang_, captained by Xanaphia. She warned them that the Dark Daggers had discovered their movements and dispatched assassins to eliminate them, convincing the crew to return to Baldur’s Gate to negotiate directly. Once there, they were escorted by Dark Dagger agents to the _Velvet Veil_—a lavish brothel that secretly served as the guild’s base. Inside, they met Laysora, the proprietor, and Valana, the leader of the Dark Daggers, who revealed that the party had effectively stolen _The Bitch’s Scorn_. However, Valana offered them a deal: keep the ship if they dealt with Zorath the Veilbinder, a wizard in the Cloud Peak Mountains who had cursed the region to harm any Dark Dagger. Accepting the mission, the party left for the mountains, battling owlbears and great apes along the way.

## Log
As the party is leaving [[campaign/locations/Baldurs Gate\|Baldurs Gate]], we are approached by another ship and it is captained by none other than [[campaign/npcs/Xanaphia\|Xanaphia]]! The ship is named the [[campaign/items/Black Fang\|Black Fang]], and Xanaphia is the captain of it. Xanaphia informs us that the [[campaign/factions/Dark Daggers\|Dark Daggers]] saw our ship leaving Baldur's Gate and sent assassins out to intercept us. She convinced us to head back to Baldur's Gate to speak with the Dark Daggers before heading to [[campaign/locations/Velen\|Velen]]. 

Once we dock in Baldurs gate again we are approached by some members of the Dark Daggers who take us to the [[campaign/locations/Velvet Veil\|Velvet Veil]], their secret hideout. The entrance is an opulent yet unassuming brothel. A half orc female, a human male, a human female, and a black male tiefling led us to [[campaign/npcs/Laysora\|Laysora]], who owns the Velvet Veil. We learn that [[campaign/npcs/Valana\|Valana]] runs the Dark Daggers. 

Valana informs us that we technically stole the [[campaign/items/Bitch's Scorn\|Bitch's Scorn]], and want it back. We are offered another option to keep the ship though. The Dark Daggers are having anissue with magic. In the [[campaign/locations/Cloud Peak Mountains\|Cloud Peak Mountains]] to the east of Baldurs Gate there is a powerful wizard named [[campaign/npcs/Zorath the Veilbinder\|Zorath the Veilbinder]]. The dark daggers had stolen from him previously, and now the dark daggers cannot approach the area, as a protective curse/barrier inflicts pain on anyone bearing the mark of the dark daggers. 

Valana offers us our ship back if we kill the Zorath or somehow remove the barrier/curse. The party agrees and sets off to the cloud peak mountains. On our way we kill some owlbears and some large apes.
