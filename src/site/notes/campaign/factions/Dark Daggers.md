Thieves guild of [[campaign/locations/4_cities_islands/Baldurs Gate\|Baldurs Gate]] , their hideout is the [[campaign/locations/6_sites/Velvet Veil\|Velvet Veil]]
## Notes
The original organization the party was enslaved by. 

Had sent assassins to kill us for taking their boat, but [[campaign/npcs/Xanaphia\|Xanaphia]] warned us before it happened. 

Members of the **Dark Daggers** earn tattoos to mark their rank: one tattoo makes them part of _the Point_, multiple tattoos elevate them to _the Edge_, and a third tattoo signifies _the Fang_.
