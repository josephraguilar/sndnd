## Notes
[[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]]'s home island and where his mother was killed. 

THe villagers of northern allyron avoid this island entirely, storms gather naturally around the islabn
inhabited solely by the uganacki clan, who's names are known as whispered legends. THe 4 brothers formed a dark pact with the followers if Iuz formed to make the Veruz Rexna.

structure of the uganacki clan Grudrack is the oldest and most disciplined, trains the half goliaths form 6-16. They have around 6 wives at any time who live in long huts on the islands, the children are raised to 6 communaly. They begin combat drills from 4, religious practices start at 6, trained brutally to 16. Moon blood fasting, blood stone ceremonies. 

The sacrifices to Iuz 

the 4 brothers are not where obold received his training on the practices of Iuz. They are not aligned religiously with iuz as their children are. They are more of followers of convenience. There are also female goliaths on the island. 

The sacrifices of Iuz were anything from animals, kind of nordic rituals where they would slice open the subjects and bath in the blood, every once in awhile they would sacrifice an intelligent race. Iuz is a battle god, and would prefer the sacrifices to come during war.
