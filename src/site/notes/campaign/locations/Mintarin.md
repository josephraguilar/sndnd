## Notes
After a giant [[Aboleth\|Aboleth]] attacked our boat, we had to land on the island to do repairs.

[[campaign/npcs/Holda\|Holda]] snuck away from the group. We thought she was abducted, tricking us into raiding a temple of [[campaign/npcs/Baphomet\|Baphomet]]. There we ran into a giant minotaur monstrosity with 4 arms and an avatar of [[campaign/npcs/Baphomet\|Baphomet]] . In order to leave safely, [[campaign/players/Obold\|Obold]] pledged his life to him.
